## Running

### Docker (Recommended)

Follow the instructions in the [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) according to your operating system.

Clone the repo, run in docker:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/memfault/interrupt.git
$ cd interrupt
$ ./interrupt-server.sh
```

You can now access the server at [http://0.0.0.0:4000](http://0.0.0.0:4000)

### Locally

You'll need:
- Python 3.8 or later
- Ruby 3.2.2

#### Install Dependencies

Clone the repo and install Python dependencies:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/memfault/interrupt.git
$ cd interrupt
# Setup a virtual environment to avoid cluttering your system
$ python3 -m venv .venv
# Activate the environment
$ source .venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The virtual environment can be deactivated with `deactivate`.

We highly recommend setting up a version manager for Ruby, such as
`rbenv`. Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) to set it
up for your operating system and install the right version of Ruby.

Install Ruby dependencies:

```bash
# Check that your Ruby version is correct
$ ruby -v
$ bundle install
```

#### Launch

Serve with the following command, which will also open up the site in your browser:

```bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve --drafts --livereload --open-url
```
