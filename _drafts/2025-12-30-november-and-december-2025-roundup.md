Memfault will be at CES 2026 connecting with engineering and product teams preparing for 2026 launches. A major theme we’re hearing: teams want fewer surprises once devices hit real customers, and better visibility into crashes, battery behavior, performance, and release quality across their fleets.  
<br>We’ll be hosting meetings in the **Venetian Tower — Suite 29-223** throughout the week, and running live demos at **Nordic Semiconductor’s booth (Venetian Expo, Halls A–D — Booth 52039, Smart Home)**.
