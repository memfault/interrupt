Files with the .bsd extension describe how to interface with a particular chip using the JTAG interface in the context of PCB and chip boundary-scan testing. Here are the main functions of these files:

1. **Chip Configuration Description:** file provides a detailed description of the chip pin configuration, including which pins support JTAG.
2. **Testing and Diagnostics Support:** These are used to support testing the PCB for shorts, open circuits, and other common problems. This is especially useful for verifying that components are properly mounted on the board.
3. **Test Automation:** allow you to automate the testing process by providing the necessary information to the software that controls the test equipment.
4. **Portability of tests:** Since BSDL is based on a standard, the files can be used with a variety of hardware and software that supports the standard, providing a high degree of test portability.

These files are a key component in the testing process of electronic devices, especially in complex systems where accurate and efficient component testing is important.

BSDL is a subset of VHDL which is a hardware description language which provide description on how a particular JTAG device need be be implemented for boundary scan. Youâ€™ll find `.bsd` files available from most vendors.

One of the major uses of BSDL is as an enabler for the development of tools to automate the testing process based on IEEE 1149.1. Tools developed to support the standard can control the TAPif they know how the boundary-scan architecture was implemented in the device. Tools can also control the I/O pins of the device. BSDL provides a standard machine and human-readable data format for describing how IEEE 1149.1 is implemented in a device.

Let's take a look at the format and syntax of BSDL files.

## Syntax

A BSDL description for a device consists of the following elements:

- Entity Descriptions
- Generic Parameter
- Logical Port Description
- Use Statements
- Pin Mapping(s)
- Scan Port Identification
- IDCODE Register Description
- Instruction Register Description
- Register Access Description
- Boundary Register Description

### Entity Descriptions

The entity statement names the entity, such as the device name (e.g., `STM32F405_415_407_417_LQFP100`). An entity description begins with an `entity` statement and terminates with an `end` statement

```VHDL
entity XYZ is
    {statements to describe the entity go here}
end XYZ
```

All of the attributes and descriptions listed below can be located within this block.

This structure allows the device to be described for testing, debugging, and diagnostic purposes, providing the necessary information for tools and equipment utilizing boundary scan technology.

### Generic Parameter

This keyword is used to define a parameter that can be changed when implementing the description in a particular device.

```VHDL
generic (PHYSICAL_PIN_MAP : string := "DW");
```

In this example, `PHYSICAL_PIN_MAP` is a generic parameter that defines the chip body type, which will default to the value "DW".

### Logical Port Description

The port description gives **logical** names to the I/O pins, and define their function as input, output, bidirectional, and so on.

```VHDL
port (
    OE    : in      bit;
    Y     : out     bit_vector(1 to 3);
    A     : in      bit_vector(1 to 3);
    GND   : linkage bit;
    VCC   : linkage bit;
    NC    : linkage bit;
    TDO   : out     bit;
    TMS   : in      bit
    TDI   : in      bit
    TCK   : in      bit
);
```

The `port` block contains both "useful" pins of the chip and the JTAG pins, as well as power, ground and missing pins - pins that are not supposed to be connected to the chip

If the port is a single port, it is marked as `bit`. If it is a bus, it is labeled as `bit_vector(X to Y)`. Inputs are `in`, outputs are `out`, bidirectional lines are `inout`. Power/ground lines as well as analog I/O and pins not connected to the crystal are marked as `linkage`.

### Use Statements

The use statement is used to indicate that a particular package or library will be used in the current context.

For example:

```VHDL
use STD_1149_1_1994.all;
```

Indicates that this file uses the IEEE 1149.1 1994 version of the IEEE 1149.1 standard library. In the BSDL context, this expression indicates that the definitions and constructs provided in the 1994 IEEE 1149.1 standard are used to describe the boundary scan behavior. This is to ensure that the description is compatible with tools supporting that standard.

### Pin Mapping(s)

This element provides a mapping of logical signals from Logical Port Description section onto the physical pins of a particular device package. This is necessary because the logical signals of a chip may be the same, but the specific pins are different for different packages.

```VHDL
attribute PIN_MAP of XYZ : entity is PHYSICAL_PIN_MAP;

constant DW:PIN_MAP_STRING:=
    "OE  :  1," &
    "Y   :  (2,3,4)," &
    "A   :  (5,6,7)," &
    "GND :  8," &
    "VCC :  9," &
    "TDO :  10," &
    "TDI :  11," &
    "TMS :  12," &
    "TCK :  13," &
    "NC  :  14";
```

The distribution of single pins is quite transparent: one logic name - one pin:

```VHDL
"OE  :  1," &
```

The buses are described next way:

```VHDL
"Y   :  (2,3,4)," &
```

### Scan Port Identification

The scan port identification statements define the device's TAP.

```VHDL
attribute TAP_SCAN_CLOCK of TCK : signal is (10.0e6, BOTH);
attribute TAP_SCAN_IN of TDI : signal is TRUE;
attribute TAP_SCAN_OUT of TDO : signal is TRUE;
attribute TAP_SCAN_MODE of TMS : signal is TRUE;
```

Values: `TAP_SCAN_CLOCK`, `TAP_SCAN_IN`, `TAP_SCAN_OUT`, `TAP_SCAN_MODE` - constants defining standard JTAG signals. Values: `TCK`, `TDI`, `TDO`, `TMS` are the port names defined in the **Pin Mapping(s)** section for a particular chip. The value `TRUE` indicates active use of this port.

Additionally, the `TAP_SCAN_CLOCK` attribute specifies the maximum frequency of the clock signal, in this example it is 10 MHz and that the signal is active on both clock edges (rising and falling). Only the `BOTH` parameter is used for the clock signal, but in general the following parameters can also be used for signals: `RISING` or `FALLING`.

### IDCODE Register Description

The `IDCODE_REGISTER` attribute is used to define the `IDCODE` register of the chip. This attribute is part of the IEEE 1149.1 (JTAG) specification.

```VHDL
attribute IDCODE_REGISTER of <entity> : entity is
    "{specific attribute value}";
```

Example:

```VHDL
attribute IDCODE_REGISTER of STM32F405_415_407_417_LQFP100: entity is
     "XXXX" &                  -- 4-bit version number
     "0110010000010011" &      -- 16-bit part number
     "00000100000" &           -- 11-bit identity of the manufacturer
     "1";                      -- Required by IEEE Std 1149.1
```

### Instruction Register Description

The Instruction Register description identifies the device-dependent characteristics of the Instruction Register.

```VHDL
attribute INSTRUCTION_LENGTH of XYZ : entity is 2;

attribute INSTRUCTION_OPCODE of XYZ : entity is
    "BYPASS (11), "&
    "EXTEST (00), "&
    "SAMPLE (10) ";

attribute INSTRUCTION_CAPTURE of XYZ : entity is "01";
```

The `INSTRUCTION_LENGTH` attribute defines the length of the `IR` register in bits.

The `INSTRUCTION_OPCODE` attribute defines the command codes.

The `INSTRUCTION_CAPTURE` attribute defines the value that will be loaded into the shift register when TAP enters the `Capture-IR` state, in other words, this attribute specifies what the instruction register is initialized with.

### Register Access Description

The register access defines which register is placed between `TDI` and `TDO` for each instruction.

As discussed in [Part 1](https://medium.com/@aliaksandr.kavalchuk/diving-into-jtag-protocol-part-1-overview-fbdc428d3a16), various codes placed in the instruction register can select various internal registers as a data register: `BYPASS`, `IDCODE`, `BSR`. The `REGISTER_ACCESS` attribute determines which instruction will connect which register as a data register.

```VHDL
attribute REGISTER_ACCESS of XYZ : entity is
    "BOUNDARY (EXTEST, SAMPLE), "&
    "BYPASS (BYPASS) ";
```

Similar to instructions that may be standard, or may be unique to a particular chip manufacturer (or a particular model), the JTAG module's plug-in registers may not be limited to a list of `DEVICE_ID`, `BYPASS`, and `BOUNDARY`. And by entering the `MY_INSTRUCTION_OPCODE` instruction in the `INSTRUCTION_OPCODE` attribute, it is possible to tell the control software in the `REGISTER_ACCESS` attribute that it wishes to connect a non-standard register if the corresponding instruction has been loaded into the instruction register:

```VHDL
attribute REGISTER_ACCESS of SIMPLE_IC : entity is
    <...>
    "MY_REG[8] (MY_INSTRUCTION)," &
    <...>
```

Here [8] defines the length of the register.

In addition, you can specify in this attribute what value the register to be connected should be initialized with when the JTAG module enters the `Capture-DR` state:

```VHDL
"MY_REG[8] (MY_INSTRUCTION CAPTURES 01010101)," &
```

### Boundary Register Description

The Boundary Register description contains a list of boundary-scan cells, along with information regarding the cell type and associated control.

```VHDL
attribute BOUNDARY_LENGTH of XYZ : entity is 7;

attribute BOUNDARY_REGISTER of XYZ : entity is
    "0 (BC_1, Y(1), output3, X, 6, 0, Z), "&
    "1 (BC_1, Y(2), output3, X, 6, 0, Z), "&
    "2 (BC_1, Y(3), output3, X, 6, 0, Z), "&
    "3 (BC_1, A(1), input, X), "&
    "4 (BC_1, A(2), input, X), "&
    "5 (BC_1, A(3), input, X), "&
    "6 (BC_1, OE, input, X), "&
    "6 (BC_1, *, control, 0)";
```

The `BOUNDARY_LENGTH` attribute specifies the total number of boundary scan cells.

The `BOUNDARY_REGISTER` attribute specifies the configuration of each boundary scan cell. Each entry in the attribute represents one cell and includes information about the cell type, associated signal, mode of operation, and optional parameters.

**Boundary Register Format:**

- **Cell Number:** The number of the scanning cell and correspondingly the bit number in the `BSR` register.
- **Cell Type (BC_1, BC_2, etc.):** Indicates the cell class defined by IEEE 1149.1. We talked about scan cell types in [last article](https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/diving-into-jtag-part-3).
- **Bound Signal:** For example, `Y(1)`, `A(1)` specifies the logical name of the signal bound to this cell.
- **Mode of Operation:** Indicates the function the cell performs: `input`, `output2`, `output3`, `bidir`, `control` or `controlr`. Again, we condemned these functions in [a past article](https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/diving-into-jtag-part-3).
- **Additional Parameters:** For example, initial values or conditions for specific modes of cell operation. For example, for the STM32F407VG microcontroller, these additional parameters are as follows:
  - `Safe` - Specifies the value with which the BSR cell should be loaded for safe operation when the program can select a random value.
  - `ccel` - The control cell number. Specifies the control cell that drives the output enable for this port. As discussed in last week's article, there can be multiple scan cells per controller pin and in such cases usually one of the scan cells is a control cell, which controls the functionality of one or more other cells, for example, by switching them between input and output modes. And this parameter indicates the number of the cell which is the control cell for this cell
  - `disval` - defines the value to be written to the control cell for it to switch this port from the "output" state to the "input" state.
  - `rslt` - resulting state. Shows the state of the driver when it is disabled.

## Conclusion

In this article we have covered the BSDL format and syntax that describe the device hardware interface for the JTAG interface including pin map, pin attributes and control functions and are supplied by the chip vendors. I will use these files in the next article where I will try to describe various JTAG usage scenarios that can be useful for the firmware engineer.
