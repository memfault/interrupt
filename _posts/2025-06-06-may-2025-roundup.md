## Articles & Learning

- [**It’s School time! Adventures in hacking kindle**](https://samkhawase.com/blog/hacking-kindle/)<br>
  So cool, a developer makes a get-ready-for-school dashboard for his daughter
  by jailbreaking an old Kindle.

- [**6 usability improvements in GCC 15**](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2025/04/10/6-usability-improvements-gcc-15)<br>
  Nice usability improvements to GCC-15. – Noah

- [**RP2350 UART ROM bootloader breakdown**](https://pfister.dev/blog/2025/rp2350-uart-bl.html)<br>
  Breakdown of the RP2350 UART ROM bootloader. Nice bit at the end using
  differential converters for longer cable lengths! – Noah

- [**How To Build A Smartwatch: Picking A Chip**](https://ericmigi.com/blog/how-to-build-a-smartwatch-picking-a-chip)<br>
  Solid MCU eval: open SDK, MIP display, decent power draw. Good if you’re
  sizing parts for wearables. – Marc

- [**Lock-Free Rust**](https://yeet.cx/blog/lock-free-rust/)<br> Fun article
  about atomics in Rust. – Noah

- [**Clang-Doc: A Modern Alternative to Doxygen**](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-doc.html)<br>
  Interesting project implementing a Doxygen alternative using LLVM LibTooling
  infrastructure, being worked on this summer as part of GSoC2025
  ([More context](https://discourse.llvm.org/t/improve-documentation-parsing-in-clang/84513)).
  – Noah

- [**Tarpaulin’s Week Of Speed**](https://xd009642.github.io/2025/05/08/Tarpaulins-Week-of-Speed.html)<br>
  Writeup on a 98% performance improvement in `cargo-tarpaulin` (code coverage
  tool for Rust). I love a good performance deep dive! – Noah

- [**From Rust to AVR assembly: Dissecting a minimal blinky program**](https://n-eq.github.io/blog/2025/05/13/rust-avr-arduino-blink)<br>
  Minimal blinky Rust AVR program breakdown. – Noah

- [**Secure A/B Updates via Raspberry Pi Firmware**](https://www.hackster.io/news/olivier-benjamin-finds-a-currently-undocumented-raspberry-pi-feature-for-secure-a-b-updates-0df38de1c9e6)<br>
  Using the Raspberry Pi firmware bootloader for updates instead of U-Boot. –
  Noah

- [**Liquid Level Sensing with Infineon PSOC 4100T**](https://www.infineon.com/AN239805)<br>
  Liquid level sensing application note using the Infineon (Cypress) PSOC 4100T
  microcontroller (PDF warning). – Noah

## Projects & Tools

- [**ghidra2dwarf**](https://github.com/cesena/ghidra2dwarf)<br> A plugin to
  generate DWARF debug information using the Ghidra reverse engineering tool. –
  Noah

- [**jetscreen-v2**](https://github.com/jetclock/jetscreen-v2)<br> Cool project
  creating a plane spotting screen using a Raspberry Pi, monitor, and USB ADS-B
  receiver. – Matti

## Interrupt Live

- [**Friday, June 6 – Interrupt Live with Martin Lampacher**](https://www.youtube.com/live/ls_Y45WsTiA)<br>
  Martin Lampacher joined Interrupt Live to share what led him to start his
  popular _Practical Zephyr_ series. We talked about why Zephyr stood out,
  what’s changed since his early experiments, and what’s got him excited in
  embedded today.

## Events

- [**Tuesday, June 10 – Coredump 10: From Pebble to Intel: Can Hardware Startups Beat the Big Players?**](https://memfault.com/resources/from-pebble-to-intel-can-hardware-startups-beat-the-big-players)<br>
  Kean Wong shares hard-won lessons from building wearables at Pebble and
  leading large teams at Intel. We’ll cover the realities of competing with
  incumbents, what scrappy teams do best, and how the two worlds can learn from
  each other. Join us live at 8AM PT | 11AM ET | 5PM CET.

- [**Tuesday, June 24 – Coredump 11: Developing Kid-Safe Tech at Gabb: What It Takes and Why It’s So Important**](https://memfault.com/resources/developing-kid-safe-tech-at-gabb-what-it-takes-and-why-its-so-important/)<br>
  When you're building tech for kids, reliability isn’t negotiable. Devices need
  to be always-on, always-connected, and dead-simple to use. Gabb’s engineering
  team joins Memfault to share how they tackle power constraints, OTA updates,
  and safety-first design. Join us live at 8AM PT | 11AM ET | 5PM CET.

- [**Tuesday, June 24 – Catch Blake’s Talk at Open Source Summit NA: Efficient On-Device Core Dump Processing for IoT**](https://ossna2025.sched.com/event/1zfib?iframe=no)<br>
  Memfault software engineer and Interrupt author Blake Hildebrand presents a
  Rust-based approach to processing Linux core dumps directly on-device (see his
  series on Linux Coredumps,
  [Part 1](https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/linux-coredumps-part-1) &
  [Part 2](https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/linux-coredumps-part-2)). He’ll
  walk through minimizing crash sizes, maintaining privacy, and scaling
  postmortem debugging for production fleets. Talk is scheduled for 9:00 AM MDT
  in Bluebird Ballroom 2B.
