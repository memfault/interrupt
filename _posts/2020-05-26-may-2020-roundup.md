reading in the comments.

## Articles & Learning

* [The Lost Art of Structure
  Packing](http://www.catb.org/esr/structure-packing/) by Eric S. Raymond<br>
While struct packing may be a lost art to web developers, it is alive and well
in embedded software engineering cycles. A great reference by ESR.
* [Nuttx International
  Workshop](https://nuttx.events/sample-page/nuttx2019-international-workshop-output/)<br>
A lot of great content came out of the Nuttx international workshop last year.
Whether you're curious about [running ROS on
Nuttx](https://nuttx.events/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Luetkebohle_nx2019.pdf),
or [want to learn more about networking
support](https://nuttx.events/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/MIshikawa_nx2019.pdf),
there is something for everyone.
* [Journaled Flash Storage – Emulating EEPROM over Flash, ACID Transactions, and
  More.](http://ithare.com/journaled-flash-storage-emulating-eeprom-over-flash-acid-transactions-and-more-part-i-flash-vs-eeprom/)
by "No Bugs" Hare<br>
A good overview of the differences between EEPROM and Flash, and how the latter
can be adapted to replace the former.
* [IoT Security Report](https://blog.heim.xyz/iot-security-report/) by Lennart
  Heim <br>
A sobering look at security risks inherent to the IoT, including an in-depth
examination of the Mirai botnet.
* [Controlling my AC with my GameBoy](http://jg.sn.sg/ir/) by jglim<br>
A fun reverse engineering project which repurposes the GameBoy IR transceiver to
control a home A/C unit.
* [Assert Rewriting - A GCC
  plugin](https://jongy.github.io/2020/04/25/gcc-assert-introspect.html) by
Jongy<br>
GCC plugins are very powerful. Here, Jongy writes a plugin to enhance the assert
functionality in their C code. It's a bit of a journey, but the end result is
impressive.
* [Custom BLE Services with the nRF SDK](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:chvBTAax3ScJ:https://64k.space/2019/10/22/custom-ble-services-with-the-nrf-sdk/&hl=en&gl=us&strip=1&vwsrc=0)<br>
Cached via Google, as the site is currently down. An in-depth guide on how to
write your own BLE services with the nRF52 family of chips. This is a great
resource as it assumes minimal prior knowledge and goes into the details.
* [Make LLVM Fast
  Again](https://nikic.github.io/2020/05/10/Make-LLVM-fast-again.html) by Nikita
Popov<br>
If compiler internals are of interest to you, you're in for a treat. This
article goes into details on how a 10% improvement in LLVM compilation times was
achieved, with links to the underlying patches submitted to the project.o
* [Embedded Game
  Programming](https://austinmorlan.com/posts/embedded_game_programming_0/) by
Austin Morlan<br>
A seven-part (!!!) series of essays on developing games for an ESP32-based game
platform (the Odroid Go). Austin goes into the details, from his build system
setup, to the display drivers or the audio implementation. A great read!
* [The 10 Commandments for C
  Programmers](https://www.lysator.liu.se/c/ten-commandments.html) by Henry
Spencer<br>
"Thou shalt not follow the NULL pointer, for chaos and madness await thee at its
end." Enough Said!
* [Black Magic Probe
  Book](https://github.com/compuphase/Black-Magic-Probe-Book)<br>
Whether you are a BMP (an open source JTAG/SWD adapter) user or not, the BMP
Book is a great reference on all things Cortex-M. We especially enjoyed the
sections about ITM and DWT.

## Videos

* [Intro to Hardware Reversing: Finding a UART and getting a
  shell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmZuKA-Rst) by
Tony Gambacorta <br>
An introductory tutorial on hardware reverse engineering, using a DLink camera
as the test subject.

## Neat Open Source Projects

* [uhubctl](https://github.com/mvp/uhubctl)<br>
A neat library to control individual ports on a wide range of USB hubs.
* [Open Vehicle Monitoring System
  3](https://github.com/openvehicles/Open-Vehicle-Monitoring-System-3)<br>
A collection of tools and libraries to interact with vehicles over CAN, OBD2,
and more.
* [SiLabs uCos](https://github.com/SiliconLabs?q=uC-&type=&language=)<br>
SiLabs open sourced uCos and all the related libraries earlier this year. There
is some extraordinarily helpful software in there, including a filesystem,
networking libraries, USB stack, and more. Best of all, the code is very clean
and very well commented.
* [Golden Gate by Fitbit](https://github.com/Fitbit/golden-gate)<br>
An ambitious, cross-platform framework for reliable and secure network
communication over BLE. By the excellent team at Fitbit.
* [MyNewt & Rust for
  PineTime](https://github.com/lupyuen/pinetime-rust-mynewt)<br>
It's no secret, we're big fans of both Apache MyNewt and Rust here on the
Interrupt Staff. This project combines both and runs them on the PineTime open
source smartwatch.
* [ESP Apple HomeKit ADK
](https://github.com/espressif/esp-apple-homekit-adk)<br>A library to implement
Apple Homekit on ESP32.

## Tools

* [Orbuculum](https://github.com/orbcode/orbuculum)<br>
Orbuculum is a set of tools for decoding and presenting output flows from the
Debug pins of a CORTEX-M CPU. Whether you are trying to do some profiling, or to
decode ITM data, Orbuculum has you covered.
* [Sigrok](https://sigrok.org/wiki/Main_Page)<br>
Sigrok has become the reference for open source signal analysis software in the
embedded space. With dozens of protocols supported, and a vast set of supported
hardware devices, it should occupy a place of choice on every firmware
engineer's toolbelt.

## News

* PacketCraft announced the new release of its [Open Source Bluetooth
  Stack](https://www.packetcraft.com/post/packetcraft-announces-public-open-source-release-of-its-bluetooth-5-2-stacks),
featuring BLE 5.2 support.
* GCC 10.1 was released recently, with some [exciting features for ARM
  users](https://community.arm.com/developer/tools-software/tools/b/tools-software-ides-blog/posts/making-the-most-of-the-arm-architecture-in-gcc-10)
