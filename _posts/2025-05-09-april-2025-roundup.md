## Articles & Learning

- [**Modern CMake Practices**](https://cliutils.gitlab.io/modern-cmake/README.html)<br>
  A best-practices wiki on how to use "Modern CMake". Not necessarily directed
  at embedded systems, but it should provide good insights about how to use
  CMake well. – Tyler

- [**Fun with `-fsanitize=undefined` and Picolibc**](https://keithp.com/blogs/sanitizer-fun/)<br>
  A surprisingly deep look at catching undefined behavior in embedded C code
  using sanitizers, with examples from real-world libc debugging. – François

- [**Demystifying the Kernel Boot Sequence**](https://bootlin.com/blog/demystifying-kernel-boot-sequence/)<br>
  Thought this was a great low-level Linux article from Bootlin. – Pat

- [**Making a Smart Bike Dumb (Work Again)**](https://francisco.io/blog/making-a-smart-bike-dumb-work-again/)<br>

  Microchip SAM (former Armel) MCUs pwned. – François

- [**Unaware and Uncertain: The Stark Realities of Cyber Resilience Act Readiness in Open Source**](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/hubfs/Research%20Reports/lfr_cra_readiness_050125a.pdf?hsLang=en)<br>
  Survey shows most of the open source world is still in the dark on CRA — 2027
  isn’t far off and everyone’s punting upstream.

## Projects & Tools

- [**NES RetroAchievements Adapter**](https://github.com/odelot/nes-ra-adapter)<br>

  adapter. – Blake

- [**Rust BLE Troubleshooting**](https://embassy.dev/blog/trouble/)<br> Rust BLE
  host stack. – Noah

- [**RunPyXL GPIO**](https://www.runpyxl.com/gpio)<br> Pretty cool, ASIC on FPGA
  to run Python code directly on silicon. – François

- [**8pinLinux: A Minimal Linux Computer**](https://dmitry.gr/?r=05.Projects&proj=36.%208pinLinux)<br>
  An interactive-speed Linux computer on a tiny board you can easily build with
  only 3 8-pin chips. – Noah

## Interrupt Live

- [**Friday, May 9 – Interrupt Live with Hayden Riddiford**](https://www.youtube.com/live/bgx4p-Voqkg?feature=shared)<br>
  Hayden Riddiford, Firmware Engineering Lead at Terra Kaffe, joined Tyler to
  dig into
  [debugging strategies for ill-defined problems](https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/debugging-steps),
  the ones where error codes fall short. Expect real-world examples and
  practical techniques for identifying and resolving vague system failures in
  embedded firmware.

- [**Friday, May 23 – Interrupt Live with Maximilian Köhl**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2t2iAYmfuE?feature=shared)<br>
  Maximilian Köhl, Founder & CEO of Silitics, joins Pat Wolfe, Linux Field
  Engineer at Memfault, to explore
  [how to simplify robust OTA updates for Linux devices](https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/robust-ota-updates-the-easy-way).
  In this live session, Maximilian will discuss Rugix, an open-source tool suite
  designed to make building custom Linux OS variants with secure over-the-air
  update support easy. Join us on YouTube Live at **9AM PT | 12PM ET | 6PM
  CET**.
