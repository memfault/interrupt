This is the start of a new article series about _Zephyr's basics_: It will walk you through Zephyr's [build and configuration systems](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/build/index.html) _West_, _Kconfig_ and _devicetree_.

**Yet another Zephyr series?**

[Zephyr's documentation](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/getting_started/index.html) aside, several very good article series exist already, e.g., the _"Getting Started with Zephyr"_ series by [Mohammed Billoo](https://www.embeddedrelated.com/blogs-1/nf/Mohammed_Billoo.php), or the Zephyr notes by [Abhijit Boseji](https://boseji.com/docs/zephyr/). Nordic Semiconductor also launched its [DevAcademy](https://academy.nordicsemi.com/), which contains a great course on the [nRF Connect SDK Fundamentals](https://academy.nordicsemi.com/courses/nrf-connect-sdk-fundamentals/): Since the _nRF Connect SDK_ is based on Zephyr, this course also teaches about Zephyr.

So why another article series, and what's different in this one?

When I first started looking into Zephyr, the learning curve felt overwhelming. Even as an embedded developer with a decent amount of experience, understanding key concepts and tools like _Kconfig_ or _devicetree_ for creating even a simple application had me chasing down the rabbit hole, following link after link after link, night after night - and it was exhausting. The existing article series would only brush over core concepts like _Kconfig_ and _devicetree_ and leave me with more questions than answers; I still needed to understand those tools since I had no previous experience with them.

What I'm trying to achieve with this article series is the following:

<!-- excerpt start -->

If you're working a full-time job and would still like to get started with Zephyr but don't have the energy to set up your environment to dive deeper into the docs, this article series will guide you through the __Zephyr basics__. Of course, you'll learn most if you follow along with programming, but all code, including snippets of generated code and build logs, are included in the articles of this series. Thus, even just reading this series should give you a good idea about how Zephyr works.

<!-- excerpt end -->

After this series, you should understand Zephyr's build and configuration tools. The learning curve flattens, and you can continue learning without getting lost in Zephyr's documentation.

> **Note:** This series is **not** for you if you're not interested in details and how things work but instead want to _use_ Zephyr. We'll go through _generated code and configuration files and learn _devicetree_ from first principles! Also, if you're experienced with Linux and already know how _Kconfig_ and _devicetree_ work, the articles of this series are just not for you.

## Series outline

As mentioned, this series covers "_Zephyr's basics_", so what is it that we'll explore in detail?

__Setup__

First, we walk through the basics of installing Zephyr and creating a minimal skeleton application. We'll see how to compile, flash, and debug an application skeleton and how Zephyr's _West_ tool fits into this. We'll improve this setup in a later article, leveraging the true potential of _West_.

__Kconfig__

In our skeleton application, we'll already stumble upon the configuration tool [Kconfig](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/build/kconfig/index.html). We'll now see how it works and how to explore, modify, and persist so-called _Kconfig symbols_, and will create our application-specific symbol. Since _Kconfig_ is also used to configure build settings, we'll see how to use _Kconfig_ for specifying _build types_.

__Devicetree basics__

Zephyr uses a tree data structure called _devicetree_ to describe hardware: All supported microcontrollers and boards are represented by a set of _devicetree sources_, which use their syntax. First, we'll skim through some device tree files in Zephyr and then create our files to explore the devicetree _syntax_.

__Devicetree bindings__

After understanding the _devicetree_ syntax, we'll now use so-called _bindings_ to add _semantics_ and, therefore _meaning_ to our devicetree. Only via devicetree _bindings_, Zephyr knows how to translate the provided devicetree into source code. Creating bindings for our nodes, we'll look at the generated output, and finally how we can access it via the Zephyr devicetree API.

__Workspaces__

Throughout this article series, for the sake of simplicity, we'll mostly use so-called _freestanding_ applications. Such applications require Zephyr's sources to be installed outside of your application. For professional applications, Zephyr's _West_ tool supports so-called _workspaces_: In workspaces, _all_ sources, their location, and their versions are specified in a _manifest_ file that is used by _West_ to populate the workspace, eliminating references to files outside of the workspace. We'll see how to create a _minimal_ workspace application using _West_.

This is where the journey **ends**. After this series, you should find it easy - or at least easier - to explore, understand, and apply advanced concepts such as:

- [application version management](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/build/version/index.html)
- using the actual [Zephyr operating system and its communication primitives](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/services/index.html),
- creating custom [device drivers](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/kernel/drivers/index.html) or integrating a [custom board](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/hardware/porting/board_porting.html),
- using integrated bootloaders such as [Mcuboot](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/services/device_mgmt/dfu.html#mcuboot),
- [testing Zephyr](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/test/index.html) applications, e.g., using its [Twister](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/test/twister.html) test runner,
- running [static code analysis](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/sca/index.html) with the integrated [code checker](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/sca/codechecker.html),
- and many more ...

... but we won't cover any of the above. All example code used throughout the articles is available in the [_practical-zephyr_ GitHub repository](https://github.com/lmapii/practical-zephyr).



## Prerequisites

You should be familiar with embedded software since we won't cover the basics. Some knowledge in using build systems such _CMake_ doesn't hurt but is not required. If you don't know what Zephyr is, look briefly at the [introduction in the official documentation](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/introduction/index.html).

The practical examples in this series use [Nordic's](https://www.nordicsemi.com/) [nRF52840 development kit](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/nrf52840-dk). If you don't have such a board, don't worry. You should be able to follow along using most of the boards in [Zephyr's long list of supported boards](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/boards/index.html) - or using an emulation target. However, we won't cover using emulation targets in this article series. Most of the content of this series does not require any hardware; we'll just _compile_ the project for a specific board for simplicity.

Whenever relevant, we'll use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as the editor of choice. However, **using `VS Code` is, of course, entirely optional** and not required at all. Only in certain sections, e.g., debugging, we'll show how using `VS Code` and some plugins can make your life easier - and we won't cover any other editor.

We won't assume any operating system, but - for the sake of simplicity - we'll be exclusively using _Linux_ shell commands. Windows users should have a "`bash`-compatible" environment - or _WSL_ - installed. We won't jump through the hoops of creating Windows-compatible shell scripts, batch files, or other atrocities.



## Installation

Let's get started - with a shortcut. Installation and toolchain management is - and probably always will be - a very biased topic. This article series is about something other than solving that problem. Therefore, I'm deliberately choosing a shortcut: We'll download "all things Zephyr" using Nordic's [toolchain manager](https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/nrf/installation/assistant.html#install-toolchain-manager) instead of following the complete installation procedure. This is optional but convenient.

Instead of using Nordic's full-blown IDE solution, we'll create our shell script to set up our terminal. This demonstrates some of the environment variables used by Zephyr and allows you to use a plain terminal to follow along.

> **Note:** In case you want a "Zephyr only" installation without downloading Nordic's software, feel free to follow the installation procedure in the [official documentation](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/getting_started/index.html) - and I'll meet you again in the [next section](#creating-an-empty-application-skeleton)!

As mentioned in the introduction, later in this series, we'll see a much better approach where Zephyr's sources will be pulled into our _workspace_ rather than separately installed: The only thing you'll need are the host tools documented in Zephyr's [getting started guide](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/getting_started/index.html#install-dependencies). For now, I'm using Nordic's toolchain installer simply to have a running setup that we can use to explore Zephyr's sources and tools.


### Setup using Nordic's toolchain manager

Nordic provides the [nRF Connect SDK](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-software/nrf-connect-sdk) for its microcontrollers. This SDK is based on Zephyr and, therefore, its version of it (plus some vendor-specific extras). Still, instead of having to go through all the installation steps of the [getting started guide](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/getting_started/index.html), it comes with a very handy [toolchain manager](https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/nrf/installation/assistant.html#install-toolchain-manager) to manage different versions of the SDK and thus also Zephyr. We'll also use it as a reference when checking the necessary steps to set up a Zephyr environment.

The nRF Connect SDK also comes with a [`VS Code` extension pack](https://nrfconnect.github.io/vscode-nrf-connect/): We'll see several of the extensions throughout this series but won't use the fully integrated solution since we want to understand what's going on underneath the hood. Go ahead and:

- Follow the [toolchain manager's instructions](https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/nrf/installation/assistant.html#install-toolchain-manager) to install the current toolchain,
- _[optional]_ install the [nRF Kconfig extension for `VS Code`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nordic-semiconductor.nrf-kconfig),
- _[optional]_ install the [nRF DeviceTree extension for `VS Code`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nordic-semiconductor.nrf-kconfig).
- If you plan to follow along using a board from Nordic, install the [command line tools](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-tools/nrf-command-line-tools).

> **Note:** If you like Nordic's [nRF Connect for `VS Code` extension pack](https://nrfconnect.github.io/vscode-nrf-connect/), you can now also skip the _toolchain manager_ installation step and install the toolchain straight from within `VS Code`.

If you're not convinced and want to install the SDK manually, you can also have a look at the steps performed in the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/lmapii/practical-zephyr/blob/main/builder.Dockerfile) in the [accompanying GitHub repository](https://github.com/lmapii/practical-zephyr). Notice that this _Dockerfile_ is tailored to the needs of this article series and is _not_ a generic solution. If you want something more generic, look at [Zephyr's docker-image repository](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/docker-image).


### Loading the development environment

After installing the toolchain manager, you can install different versions of the nRF Connect SDK. E.g. my current list of installations looks as follows:

![]({% img_url practical-zephyr/nrf-toolchain-mgr.png %})

However, when using Zephyr's tools in your normal command line, you should notice that the commands cannot be located yet. E.g., this is the output of my `zsh` terminal when trying to execute [Zephyr's meta-tool _West_](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/west/index.html) (we'll see the tool later):

```zsh
$ west --version
zsh: command not found: west
```

As you can see in the above screenshot of the [toolchain manager](https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/nrf/installation/assistant.html#install-toolchain-manager), Nordic gives you several options to launch your development environment with all paths set up correctly:

- Open a terminal,
- generate your own `env.sh`, which you can then `source` in your terminal of choice,
- open a dedicated `VS Code` instance for the chosen SDK version.

Since we want a better idea of what's happening underneath it all, we'll use *none* of the above options. Instead, we create our own `setup.sh` script based on the `env.sh` the toolchain manager generates for you.


### Analyzing the `env.sh` script provided by Nordic

First, generate an `env.sh` script using the toolchain manager. At the time of writing, the script configures the following variables when `source`d:

- `PATH` is extended by several `bin` folders containing executables used by the nRF Connect SDK (and Zephyr).
- `GIT_EXEC_PATH` and `GIT_TEMPLATE_DIR` are set to the versions used by the SDK. Git uses these environment variables for [sub-commands](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Environment-Variables) and the default repository setup when using [templates](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-init#_template_directory), e.g., for the initial content of your `.gitignore.`
- `ZEPHYR_TOOLCHAIN_VARIANT`, `ZEPHYR_SDK_INSTALL_DIR`, and `ZEPHYR_BASE` are Zephyr-specific environment variables which we'll explain just now.


### Creating a setup script

Instead of using the provided `env.sh` script, we'll use a stripped-down version to explore the ecosystem and get to know the most important environment variables. You can find the complete [setup script](https://github.com/lmapii/practical-zephyr/blob/main/setup.sh) in the root folder of the [accompanying GitHub repository](https://github.com/lmapii/practical-zephyr).

After installing a toolchain with the [toolchain manager](https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/nrf/installation/assistant.html#install-toolchain-manager) you should see a tree similar to the following in your installation directory, in my case `/opt/nordic/ncs`:

```bash
tree /opt/nordic/ncs --dirsfirst -L 2 -I downloads -I tmp
/opt/nordic/ncs
├── toolchains
│   ├── 4ef6631da0
│   └── toolchains.json
└── v2.4.0
    ├── bootloader
    ├── modules
    ├── nrf
    ├── nrfxlib
    ├── test
    ├── tools
    └── zephyr
```

The toolchain - and therefore **all** required host tools - are installed in a separate folder _toolchains_, whereas the actual SDK is placed in a folder with its version name. We'll make use of this to first set up our `$PATH` variable with a minimal set of `bin` directories from the installation:

```sh
ncs_install_dir=/opt/nordic/ncs
ncs_sdk_version=v2.4.0
ncs_bin_version=4ef6631da0
shell_name=$(basename "$SHELL")

paths=(
    $ncs_install_dir/toolchains/$ncs_bin_version/bin
    $ncs_install_dir/toolchains/$ncs_bin_version/opt/nanopb/generator-bin
)

for entry in ${paths[@]}; do
    export PATH=$PATH:$entry
done
```

> **Note:** Depending on whether or not you want to replace _all_ binaries - including `git` - with Nordic's installation, _append_ or _prepend_ to `PATH`. In the above example, we _append_ and thus use local installations over the installation provided by the toolchain installer, if available.

After sourcing this script, you should now have, e.g., [Zephyr's meta-tool _West_](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/west/index.html) and [CMake](https://cmake.org/) in your path:

```bash
$ source setup.sh
$ which cmake
/opt/nordic/ncs/toolchains/4ef6631da0/bin/cmake
$ which west
/opt/nordic/ncs/toolchains/4ef6631da0/bin/west
```

Only [two environment variables are significant](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/env_vars.html#important-environment-variables) when configuring the toolchain:
- [`ZEPHYR_SDK_INSTALL_DIR`](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/env_vars.html#envvar-ZEPHYR_SDK_INSTALL_DIR) must be set to the installation directory of the SDK,
- [`ZEPHYR_TOOLCHAIN_VARIANT`](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/beyond-GSG.html#install-a-toolchain) selects the toolchain to use, e.g., `llvm` or in our case `zephyr`.

> **Note:** Yes, the inconsistent use of the term "SDK" is quite annoying. Nordic uses the term "SDK" to refer to its sources, whereas Zephyr uses _SDK_ to refer to the toolchain. I'm used to Nordic's terminology where an SDK also includes source code.

Once those environment variables are set, we can source the `zephyr-env.sh` that is provided by Zephyr itself, as shown below. This [Zephyr environment script](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/env_vars.html#zephyr-environment-scripts) is the recommended way to load an environment in case Zephyr is not installed globally.

```sh
# continuing setup.sh from the previous snippet
export ZEPHYR_TOOLCHAIN_VARIANT=zephyr
export ZEPHYR_SDK_INSTALL_DIR=$ncs_install_dir/toolchains/$ncs_bin_version/opt/zephyr-sdk
source $ncs_install_dir/$ncs_sdk_version/zephyr/zephyr-env.sh
west zephyr-export
```

Instead of setting `ZEPHYR_BASE` manually as, e.g., done by the `env.sh` script generated via the Nordic toolchain manager, `ZEPHYR_BASE` is now set by the `zephyr-env.sh` script (we'll see how `ZEPHYR_BASE` is used when building our application). In addition, this also allows [using `.zephyrrc` files](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/env_vars.html#option-3-using-zephyrrc-files) in your application root directory - a feature we won't cover in this series.

The final command, `west zephyr-export`, is a ["Zephyr extension command"](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/west/zephyr-cmds.html#installing-cmake-packages-west-zephyr-export) that installs the required _CMake_ packages that we'll need in the next steps when using `find_package` to locate Zephyr's sources in a `CMakeLists.txt` file.

That's it for the environment; we can now create applications. One last time, this was just a warm-up to start with Zephyr. It is not required or recommended to use such a `setup.sh` script; it's just one of many possibilities you have when bringing up your development environment.



## Creating an empty application skeleton

Now that we have a working installation, we can start with the important parts of this article series. Before creating our first files, let's review Zephyr's supported application _types_.

### Zephyr application types

Zephyr supports different [application types](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/application/index.html#application-types), differentiated by the location of your application in relation to Zephyr's sources

- [Freestanding applications](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/application/index.html#zephyr-freestanding-app) exist independent of Zephyr's location, meaning Zephyr is not part of the application's repository or file tree. The relation with Zephyr is only established in the build process when using `find_package` to locate Zephyr, typically based on the `ZEPHYR_BASE` environment variable.
- [Workspace applications](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/application/index.html#zephyr-workspace-app) use a [_West_ workspace](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/west/workspaces.html#west-workspaces): For such applications, _West_ is used to initialize your workspace, e.g., based on a `west.yml` manifest file. _ West _ uses the manifest file to create complex workspaces: The location and revision are specified in the manifest file for each external dependency used in your project. West then uses this manifest to populate your workspace—like a very, very powerful version of [Git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).
- [Zephyr repository applications](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/application/index.html#zephyr-repo-app) live within the Zephyr repository itself, e.g., demo applications that are maintained with Zephyr. You could add applications in a fork of the Zephyr repository, but this is not very common.

The most common and easiest approach is to **start** with a freestanding application: You'll only need a couple of files to get started. As with the nRF Connect SDK, Zephyr is configured via the environment in a known installation directory.

In more advanced projects, you typically want all dependencies in your workspace. You will, therefore, switch to a workspace application type: External dependencies will be cloned directly into your project by _West_ to avoid depending on separate local installations. We'll get to that at the end of this article series.

We'll rely entirely on the [freestanding application type](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/application/index.html#zephyr-freestanding-app).

### A skeleton freestanding application

The steps to create an application from scratch are also documented in [Zephyr's documentation](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/application/index.html#creating-an-application-by-hand). We'll simply repeat them here and add some explanations, where necessary. Start by creating the following skeleton:

```bash
$ tree --charset=utf-8 --dirsfirst
.
├── src
│   └── main.c
├── CMakeLists.txt
└── prj.conf
```

You should immediately notice that we're using a `CMakeLists.txt`. Zephyr's build system is based on [CMake](https://cmake.org/). You've read that right: Zephyr provides its own meta-tool _West_, which uses yet another meta build system _CMake_, which will, in turn, e.g., use `make` or `ninja`.

> **Note:** You can find the complete application skeleton, including some additional comments, in the [`00_basics` folder of the accompanying GitHub repository](https://github.com/lmapii/practical-zephyr/tree/main/00_basics).

#### West vs. CMake

[West](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/west/index.html) is Zephyr's "Swiss army knife tool": It is mainly used for managing multiple repositories but also provides [Zephyr extension commands](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/west/zephyr-cmds.html) for building, flashing, and debugging applications. [CMake](https://cmake.org/), on the other hand, is used exclusively for building your application.

Since we want to learn how things work underneath, for the following steps, we'll be using _CMake_ first and circle back to _West_ after exploring the build process.

#### Kconfig

Our application skeleton also has a very suspicious `prj.conf` file. This file must exist for any application, even if empty, and is used by the [Kconfig configuration system](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/build/kconfig/index.html). We'll go into detail about [Kconfig](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/build/kconfig/index.html) (and *devicetree*) later in this series.

For now, simply keep in mind that we'll be using this configuration file to tell the build system which modules and which features we want to use in our application. Anything we don't plan on using will be deactivated, decreasing the size of our application and reducing compilation times.

#### Sources

Aside from our build and configuration file, we've created a still empty [`src/main.c`](https://github.com/lmapii/practical-zephyr/blob/main/00_basics/src/main.c) file. The convention is to place all sources in this `src` folder, but you might need a more complex setup as your application grows. For now, that'll do.



## Writing and building a dummy application

### Source code

Our `main.c` file contains our application code. We'll just provide a dummy application that does nothing but send our MCU back to sleep repeatedly:

```c
#include <zephyr/kernel.h>

void main(void)
{
    while (1)
    {
        k_msleep(100U); // Sleep for 100 ms.
    }
}
```

Notice that this is a plain infinite loop and it doesn't make any use of threads yet - something that you'll change in a more complex application: In the end, it makes limited sense to use Zephyr without its operating system. For now, keep in mind that [applications _can_ operate without threads](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/kernel/services/threads/nothread.html#nothread), though this severely limits the functionality provided by Zephyr.

### Build configuration

Now we come to the heart of this first step towards Zephyr: The build configuration. In case you're not familiar at all with *CMake*, there are several articles and even books about ["Effective Modern CMake"](https://gist.github.com/mbinna/c61dbb39bca0e4fb7d1f73b0d66a4fd1): *CMake* has evolved significantly, and only certain patterns should be used for new applications. We won't explain *CMake* here, but if you're an experienced developer, you should understand the basics just fine when reading along.

Let's go through the steps to create our `CMakeLists.txt` for this empty application:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.20.0)

set(BOARD nrf52840dk_nrf52840)
find_package(Zephyr REQUIRED HINTS $ENV{ZEPHYR_BASE})
```

- `cmake_minimum_required` just indicates the allowed CMake versions. Zephyr has its requirements and maintains its minimal required CMake version in `zephyr/cmake/modules/zephyr_default.cmake`.
- The `set` function writes the board we're building our application for to the variable `BOARD`. This step is optional and can be specified during the build step as a parameter. `nrf52840dk_nrf52840` is Zephyr's name for the [nRF52840 development kit](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/nrf52840-dk).
- Then, we load Zephyr using the `find_package` function. In our [setup script](#creating-a-setup-script), we've exported the `ZEPHYR_BASE` environment variable, which is now passed as a hint to the `find_package` function to locate the correct Zephyr installation.

> **Note:** There are several ways to use the Zephyr CMake package, each of which is described in detail in [Zephyr's CMake package documentation](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/build/zephyr_cmake_package.html). You can also have a look at the [Zephyr CMake package source code](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/build/zephyr_cmake_package.html#zephyr-cmake-package-source-code) for details.

As mentioned, setting the `BOARD` variable is optional and usually not done. The value for the `BOARD` can be chosen in different ways, e.g., using an environment variable, or passed as a parameter during the build. The Zephyr build system determines the final value for `BOARD` in a pre-defined order; refer to the [documentation for the application CMakeLists.txt](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/application/index.html#application-cmakelists-txt) for details.

> **Note**: Zephyr's goal is to support multiple boards and multiple MCUs. Once we switch to using _West_ for building, it makes sense to pass the board as a parameter and _not_ specify it in `CMakeLists.txt`. In case you're having trouble remembering the exact board name, you can always dump the list of supported boards using the command `west boards`.

Now that Zephyr is available, we can go ahead and add the application:

```cmake
project(
    EmptyApp
    VERSION 0.1
    DESCRIPTION "Empty zephyr application."
    LANGUAGES C
)

target_sources(
    app
    PRIVATE
    src/main.c
)
```

- The `project` function defines the name and settings of the application project.
- Then, we simply need to add our sources to the `app` target.

But wait. What's this `app` target, and why don't we need to specify an executable? This is all done within the Zephyr CMake package: The package already defines your executable and also provides this `app` library target which is intended to be used for all application code. At the time of writing, this `app` target is constructed by the following CMake files in the Zephyr project:

`zephyr/cmake/modules/kernel.cmake`
```cmake
zephyr_library_named(app)
```

`zephyr/cmake/modules/extensions.cmake`
```cmake
macro(zephyr_library_named name)
  set(ZEPHYR_CURRENT_LIBRARY ${name})
  add_library(${name} STATIC "")
  zephyr_append_cmake_library(${name})
  target_link_libraries(${name} PUBLIC zephyr_interface)
endmacro()
```

### Building the application

With the `CMakeLists.txt` in place, we can build the application. There are several ways to do this and if you're familiar with CMake, the below commands are no surprise. What we want to show, however, is the slight differences between using CMake or _West_ when building your application. Let's first use CMake:

#### Building with CMake

```bash
$ cmake -B ../build
$ cmake --build ../build -- -j4
```

> **Note:** The [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lmapii/practical-zephyr) uses subfolders for all example applications. Using a build directory `../build` located in the root of the repository allows an editor such as `VS Code` to pick up the compile commands independent of the example that is being built. In case you're using `VS Code`, have a look at the provided [`settings.json`](https://github.com/lmapii/practical-zephyr/blob/main/.vscode/settings.json) file.

With this, the `../build` folder contains the application built for the `BOARD` specified in the `CMakeLists.txt` file. The following command allows passing the `BOARD` to CMake directly and thereby either **overrides** a given `set(BOARD ...)` instruction or provides the `BOARD` in case it hasn't been specified at all:

```bash
# Build for a specific board determined during build time.
$ cmake -B ../build -DBOARD=nrf52dk_nrf52832
```

Let's try to build the application using _West_:

```bash
$ rm -rf ../build
$ west build -d ../build
WARNING: This looks like a fresh build and BOARD is unknown; so it probably won't work. To fix, use --board=<your-board>.
Note: to silence the above message, run 'west config build.board_warn false'
<truncated output>
```

> **Note:** The default build directory of _West_ is a `build` folder within the same directory. If run without `-d ../build`, _West_ will create a `build` folder in the current directory for the build.

The build seems to succeed, but there's a warning indicating that no board has been specified. How is that possible? _West_ typically still expects a "board configuration" or the `--board` parameter. The reason for this is simple: _West_ is much more than just a wrapper for CMake and therefore doesn't parse the provided `CMakeLists.txt` file - where we specified the `BOARD`. It just warns you that you may have forgotten to specify the `board` but still proceeds to call CMake.

Before looking another step deeper into West, comment or **delete** the `set(BOARD ...)` instruction in your `CMakeLists.txt` file.


#### Building with West

As mentioned, _West_ needs an indication of which board is being used by your project. Just like plain CMake, this could be done by specifying the `BOARD` as an environment variable or by passing the board to `west build`:

```bash
# pass the board as argument
$ west build --board nrf52840dk_nrf52840 -d ../build
# or using an environment variable
$ export BOARD=nrf52840dk_nrf52840
$ west build -d ../build
```

Underneath, _West_ sets up the build directory and then simply invokes CMake. Thus, everything build-related is still plain old CMake. The above builds run without warning.

> **Note:** The `build` command is actually a so-called [_West_ extension command](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/west/zephyr-cmds.html) and is not built into _West_ by default. You could thus, e.g., use _West_ without Zephyr as a repository manager in a different context. Zephyr provides extension commands such as [`build`, `flash`, and `debug`](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/west/build-flash-debug.html) in its own _West_ extension such that applications can be built, flashed, and debugged in the same way, independent of, e.g., the debugger or programmer that is used. If you're interested in how Zephyr's extensions work, have a look at `zephyr/scripts/west-commands.yml` and the corresponding _West_ extension scripts.

Once the build folder has been created using any of the above commands, it is no longer necessary to pass the board to _West_:

```bash
# in case the build directory exists already ...
$ if test -d ../build; then echo "build directory exists!"; fi
build directory exists!
# ... it is no longer necessary to specify the board:
$ west build -d ../build
```

Alternatively, we can use [West's build configuration options](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/west/build-flash-debug.html#configuration-options) to fix the board in the executing terminal. These options are similar to environment variables but are configuration options _only_ relevant to West. We can list the current West configuration options using `west config -l`:

```bash
$ west config -l
manifest.path=nrf
manifest.file=west.yml
zephyr.base=zephyr
```

The listed configuration options are part of [West's built-in configuration options](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/west/config.html#built-in-configuration-options) and come from the West workspace configuration. Since we're using a freestanding application, we'll ignore these options and focus on our build settings. We can add a default board configuration to our settings as follows:

```bash
$ west config build.board nrf52840dk_nrf52840
$ west config -l
manifest.path=nrf
manifest.file=west.yml
zephyr.base=zephyr
build.board=nrf52840dk_nrf52840
# It is also possible to delete an option
#, e.g., using `west config -d build.board`
```

> **Note:** The _West_ configuration options can also be used to define arguments for CMake. This can be useful when debugging or when defining your own CMake caches, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/west/build-flash-debug.html#permanent-cmake-arguments) for details.

Now, we can run `west build` in our current terminal without specifying a board.

```bash
$ west build -d ../build
```

Notice that CMake does not pick up _West_'s configuration options, so executing `cmake -B ../build` would fail. One last parameter for `west build` that is worth mentioning is `--pristine`: Just like the `--pristine` option for `CMake`, instead of deleting the `build` folder, you can also use the `--pristine` to generate a new build:

```bash
$ west build -d ../build --pristine
```



## A quick glance at IDE integrations

In the [prerequisites](#prerequisites), we've promised that we won't have a detailed look at IDEs - and we won't. In this section, we'll just have a look at `VS Code` and some information that is relevant for any type of editor. Let's start with the editor-independent information:

Zephyr configures CMake to export a _compilation database_ and thus produces a `compile_commands.json` file in the build directory:

`zephyr/cmake/modules/kernel.cmake`
```cmake
set(CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS TRUE CACHE BOOL
    "Export CMake compile commands. Used by gen_app_partitions.py script"
    FORCE
)
```

This compilation database essentially contains the commands that are used for each and every file that is compiled in the project. The database is not only used by tools such as [`clang-tidy`](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy) but also by IDEs and their extensions, e.g., to resolve include paths.

E.g., `VS Code` has a [C/C++ extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools), which can be configured to pick up the provided compilation database as follows in `VS Code`'s [`settings.json`](https://github.com/lmapii/practical-zephyr/blob/main/.vscode/settings.json):

`.vscode/settings.json`
```json
{
  "C_Cpp.default.compileCommands": "build/compile_commands.json",
}
```

If you like `VS Code` and use [Nordic](https://www.nordicsemi.com/)'s MCUs, you can also have a look at their [extension pack](https://nrfconnect.github.io/vscode-nrf-connect/), which comes with a graphical *devicetree* and *KConfig* extension, debugging support, and much more:

![]({% img_url practical-zephyr/nrf-vscode.png %})

> **Note:** Personally, I do not use the full extension pack since one key reason for using Zephyr is being able to use MCUs from _any_ supported vendor. I also tend to stick to the command line since I want to understand the process and do not rely on buttons in an IDE. Also, the extension pack somewhat conflicts with the very popular CMake extension [`ms-vscode.cmake-tools`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools). But in general, [Nordic](https://www.nordicsemi.com/) did a great job of providing an easy way to develop applications with their extension pack. My only hope would be, that they'll make the *Kconfig* and *devicetree* extensions usable without the full extension pack.

And that's it about IDE integrations! Ok, almost, we'll still see them every now and then in the article series.



## Flashing and debugging

Having built our first freestanding application, let's have a brief look at how we can flash and debug it on our target. We can do both using the `flash` and `debug` [extension commands](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/west/build-flash-debug.html) provided by Zephyr for _West_. With the development kit plugged in, all we need to do is run `west flash` to program the MCU (the parameter `-d` is necessary to select the correct build directory in case it isn't located in the executing folder):

```bash
west flash -d ../build
-- west flash: rebuilding
ninja: no work to do.
-- west flash: using runner nrfjprog
Using board 123456789
-- runners.nrfjprog: Flashing file: ../build/zephyr/zephyr.hex
Parsing image file.
Verifying programming.
Verified OK.
Enabling pin reset.
Applying pin reset.
-- runners.nrfjprog: Board with serial number 123456789 flashed successfully.
```

> **Note:** In case you haven't followed the [installation](#installation) in this article but instead used your own setup, this step might not succeed: As you can see, _West_ uses Nordic's [nRF Command Line Tool](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-tools/nrf-command-line-tools) `nrfjprog` to program the development kit. In case this tool isn't available, the execution will fail. In general, flashing and debugging is always very target specific and you'll need to ensure that the correct tools are installed.

Wait, so how does Zephyr know which USB device to flash and _how_ to do this? _West_ uses so-called [flash and debug **runners**](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/west/build-flash-debug.html#flash-and-debug-runners). In the above output, you can see that it selects Nordic's `nrfjprog` [command line tool](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-tools/nrf-command-line-tools) as _runner_, which is, in turn, able to identify whether or not a board is connected to your computer. In case only a single matching board is present, it automatically programs that board.

The _West_ extension command `debug` works similarly:

```bash
$ west debug -d ../build
-- west debug: rebuilding
ninja: no work to do.
-- west debug: using runner jlink
-- runners.jlink: JLink version: 7.66a
-- runners.jlink: J-Link GDB server running on port 2331; no thread info available
SEGGER J-Link GDB Server V7.66a Command Line Version

...

--Type <RET> for more, q to quit, c to continue without paging--
(gdb)
```

Here, _West_ selected the J-Link runner since the development kit comes with a J-Link debugger. We end up with a `gdb` console which we can use to debug our application:

```bash
(gdb) break main
Breakpoint 1 at 0x4730: file /path/to/src/main.c, line 11.
(gdb) continue
Continuing.

Breakpoint 1, main () at /path/to/src/main.c:11
11              k_msleep(SLEEP_TIME_MS);
(gdb) next

Breakpoint 1, main () at /path/to/src/main.c:11
11              k_msleep(SLEEP_TIME_MS);
(gdb) next

Breakpoint 1, main () at /path/to/src/main.c:11
11              k_msleep(SLEEP_TIME_MS);
```

Debugging with `gdb` may be all you need, especially if you pair this with Python scripts.


### Debugging ARM Cortex-M targets in `VS Code`

Aside from plain `gdb`, step debugging in your editor of choice is another very popular approach.

`VS Code` is becoming more and more prominent, which is why it is worth mentioning that debugging solutions exist that allow step debugging within the editor, e.g., via the [`cortex-debug`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marus25.cortex-debug) extension for ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers.

Setting up debugging in `VS Code` is explained in the [official documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging), and comes down to providing launch configurations in the JSON file `.vscode/launch.json`. The following is an example file that can be used to debug Zephyr applications on boards using the nRF52840 microcontroller:

`.vscode/launch.json`
```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "nRF52840_xxAA - attach",
      "device": "nRF52840_xxAA",
      "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
      "executable": "build/zephyr/zephyr.elf",
      "request": "launch",
      "type": "cortex-debug",
      "runToEntryPoint": "main",
      "servertype": "jlink",
      "gdbPath": "/opt/nordic/ncs/toolchains/4ef6631da0/opt/zephyr-sdk/arm-zephyr-eabi/bin/arm-zephyr-eabi-gdb"
    }
  ]
}
```

> **Note:** Support for GDB comes out of the box with `VS Code` and could also be used instead of relying on `cortex-debug`. Also, in case you're sourcing `setup.sh` before launching `VS Code`, you can use the environment variable for the `gdbPath` setting, e.g., `"gdbPath": "${env:ZEPHYR_SDK_INSTALL_DIR}/arm-zephyr-eabi/bin/arm-zephyr-eabi-gdb"`

![]({% img_url practical-zephyr/vscode-debug.png %})

Your mileage, however, will always vary according to the MCU that you're using, and there is no generic solution. Zephyr's official documentation also comes with a dedicated [section about debugging](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/debug/index.html), and a separate section about [flash & debug host tools](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/flash_debug/host-tools.html). Pick your poison!

Another great resource about `VS Code` with Zephyr is [Jonathan Beri's presentation "Zephyr & Visual Studio Code: How to Develop Zephyr Apps with a Modern, Visual IDE"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKNHPmG-Qxo) from the 2023 Zephyr Development Summit.



## Conclusion

In this article, we installed Zephyr and its tools using Nordic's [toolchain manager](https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/nrf/installation/assistant.html#install-toolchain-manager), and with it have a base environment that we'll use in this series. Since your preference for development environments and installation for sure greatly varies, finding the matching solution will always be your own task. With the contents of the `setup.sh` script that we created in this article, you should have a good idea about what's involved when creating your own setup.

> **Note:** The example application skeleton created throughout this article is available in the [`00_basics` folder of the accompanying GitHub repository](https://github.com/lmapii/practical-zephyr/tree/main/00_basics).

We then had a quick look at Zephyr's application types and created a skeleton _freestanding_ application, which we've compiled using CMake directly, and via Zephyr's meta-tool _West_. We've seen how we can parameterize our build to pick a certain _board_ and concluded, that it might be beneficial to use _West_ over plain CMake - but you can always pick your preference.

We then brushed over the extension commands `flash` and `debug` that allow us to program the application to our board and debug it using `gdb`. Finally, we've had a quick look at a possible `VS Code` debugging integration.

Next up in line for this article series is _Kconfig_, which we briefly encountered when we created the minimum set of files for a freestanding application - which included a `prj.conf` file.
