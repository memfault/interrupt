## Articles & Learning

- [**Let's code a TCP/IP stack, 1: Ethernet & ARP**](https://www.saminiir.com/lets-code-tcp-ip-stack-1-ethernet-arp/)<br>
  Fun series walking through how to build a TCP/IP stack from scratch. Ôºç Noah

- [**The End of Programming**](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/the-end-of-programming-as-we-know-it/)<br>
  An interesting blog (rant) about programming and AI. I liked the comment,
  ‚ÄúEventually much of what programmers do today may be as obsolete (for everyone
  but embedded system programmers) as the old skill of debugging with an
  oscilloscope.‚Äù Ôºç Niall Cooling, Interrupt Community Member

- [**Removing Jeff Bezos from My Bed**](https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/removing-jeff-bezos-from-my-bed)<br>
  Fun read on de-Amazoning your home network and the weird behavior you uncover
  along the way. ‚Äî Fran√ßois

- [**ESP32 Wi-Fi Superstitions**](https://supakeen.com/weblog/esp32-wifi-superstitions/)<br>
  Breaks down what actually matters when trying to get stable Wi-Fi on ESP32;
  turns out most "tips" are just noise. ‚Äî Fran√ßois

- [**Yocto, RockPi, and SBOMs: Building Modern Embedded Linux Images**](https://vpetersson.com/2025/02/21/yocto-rockpi-and-sboms.html)<br>

- [**A Rustacean's Guide to Embedded World 2025**](https://onevariable.com/blog/ew25-guide/)<br>
  Published just before Embedded World (Mar 11‚Äì13), this guide from
  [OneVariable‚Äôs](https://www.onevariable.com/blog/) James Munns highlights
  Rust-focused booths, tools, and sessions; still worth a read if you‚Äôre
  tracking where embedded Rust is gaining traction.

- [**Just Barely Fitting a Full Wi-Fi Stack on the nRF9151**](https://danielmangum.com/posts/nrf9151-wifi-station/)<br>

  ESP32 chips.

- [**It‚Äôs Not As Simple As ‚ÄúUse A Memory Safe Language"**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQ-eTaW6-cM)
  Very balanced coverage of memory safety with a pragmatic comparison of Rust
  and Modern C++. Well worth a view. Ôºç Niall Cooling, Interrupt Community
  Member
