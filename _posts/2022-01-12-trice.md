If you develop software for an embedded system, you need some kind of system feedback. Debuggers are awesome tools, but when it comes to analyzing dynamic behavior in the field, they cannot be used.

For remote debugging, many engineers turn to `printf`, which can usually be quickly put in place after having a `putchar()` implemented. This turns out to be an expensive way, in terms of processor clocks and required FLASH memory for the strings.

If you're using a bigger microcontroller, you might have tracing hardware like an ETM. but it requires expensive tools and a direct connection, so it can not be used to debug in-field issues.

Unhappy with this situation, you might start building clever solutions to do in-field debugging, such as using digital pins, streaming byte sequences of tracing data, or even emitting some proprietary LED blinking codes, all of which would be difficult to build and interpret.

Embedded engineers need something as easy to use as `printf`, usable within interrupts, small enough for today's MCU's, and have minimal performance impact when running. The _Trice_ technique tries to fill this gap. It is the result of a long-year dissatisfaction and several attempts to find a loophole to make embedded programming more fun and effective.

## Brief Description of Trice

_Trice_ is a small, performant software tracer and logger and consists of these parts

- [trice.c](https://github.com/rokath/trice/tree/master/pkg/src/trice.c) contains the [less than 1KB](https://github.com/rokath/trice/tree/master/docs/TriceSpace.md) runtime code, which uses [triceConfig.h](https://github.com/rokath/trice/tree/master/test/MDK-ARM_STM32G071RB/Core/Inc/triceConfig.h) as setup.
- [trice.h](https://github.com/rokath/trice/tree/master/pkg/src/trice.h) containing a **C** language macro `TRICE`, generating [tiny code](https://github.com/rokath/trice/tree/master/docs/TriceSpeed.md) for getting real-time `printf` comfort at "speed-of-light" for any microcontroller.
  <br>Example:

  ```c
  float x = 3.14159265/4;
  TRICE( Id(12345), "info:Ï€/4 is %f with the bit pattern %032b\n",
      aFloat(x), x );
  ```

- PC tool **trice**, executable on all [Go](https://golang.org) platforms.

## The History of _Trice_

Developing firmware means dealing with interrupts and timing. How do you check if an interrupt occurred? You might increment a counter and display it in a background loop with some printf-like function. What about time measurement? Set a digital output to 1 and 0 and connect a measurement device like an oscilloscope or [Saleae](https://www.saleae.com/).

I once was developing software for a real-time image processing device, and I had to hunt down what was causing a regression in processing time. A spare analog output with a video interrupt-synced oscilloscope gave me the needed information after I changed the analog output on several points in my algorithm. But this isn't ideal. I just want to deal with my programming tasks and not worry about connecting wires and extra instruments.

`printf` is so cool on a PC, but an embedded device often cannot use it for performance reasons. And thus began the quest to build something better.

My very first attempt was writing the format string `.const` offset together with its values in a FIFO during a log statement and to do the `printf` in the background. Unfortunately, this is compiler specific. I modified it to use the full string address instead of the offset, but that needed more buffer space. [Zephyr](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/reference/logging/index.html), for example, does something like this and calls it "deferred logging".

Then, one day I had the idea to compute short checksums of the format strings in a pre-compile step and to use them as IDs in a list together with the format strings. That was a step forward but then I needed to write a supporting PC program to decode the information. I did that in C++ in an attempt to get something functional quickly, but I hated it, as I dislike C++ now because of all its nuts and bolts, not to mention the missing libraries issues when running it on a different PC. There was also the problem of conflicting generated short checksums. There was a way around it, but ID-based message filtering will never be possible with this issue.

The need became clear for controllable IDs and management options. I chose to implement the new solution using [Go](https://golang.org) as it was an as-fast-as-**C** language, easy to learn, promising high programming efficiency and portability. It would be interesting to try it out on a real PC project. This is the origin story of [_Trice_](https://github.com/rokath/trice).

_Trice_ grew, and as it got more usable, I decided to make it Open Source as a "Thank You" to the community.

> _Trice_ is also a [baby girl's name](https://www.babynamespedia.com/meaning/Trice), and our daughter designed the logo. The girl's pen symbolizes the `TRICE` macro for recording and the eyeglasses represent the PC tool **trice** for visualizing the logs.

## How It Works

_Trice_ performs **zero** [costly](https://github.com/rokath/trice/tree/master/docs/TriceVsPrintfSimilaritiesAndDifferences.md#printf-like-functions) printf-like functions on the target at all. The `TRICE` macro, instead, just copies an ID together with the optional values to a buffer. In the minimum case, this can happen in [6-8](https://github.com/rokath/trice/tree/master/docs/TriceSpeed.md) processor clocks even with target timestamps included. When running on a 64 MHz clock, **light can travel about 30 meters in that time**.

To achieve this, an automatic pre-compile step is triggered by executing a `trice update` command on the PC. The **trice** tool then parses the source tree for macros like `TRICE( "msg: %d Kelvin\n", k );` and patches them to `TRICE( Id(12345), "msg: %d Kelvin\n", k );`, where `12345` is a generated 16-bit identifier copied into a [**T**rice **I**D **L**ist](https://github.com/rokath/trice/tree/master/til.json). During compilation than, the `TRICE` macro is translated to the `12345` ID and the optional parameter values. The format string is ignored by the compiler.

The target code is [project-specific](https://github.com/rokath/trice/tree/master/test/MDK-ARM_STM32G071RB/Core/Inc/triceConfig.h) and can be configured by modifying this header file. In **immediate mode**, the stack is used as the _Trice_ buffer and the TRICE macro execution includes the quick [COBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_Overhead_Byte_Stuffing) encoding and the data transfer. This more straightforward, but slower architecture, can be interesting for many cases because it is anyway much faster than printf-like functions calls. In **deferred mode**, a service swaps the _Trice_ double buffer periodically, encodes it according to COBS, and the background transfer is triggered.

During runtime, the PC **trice** tool receives everything that happened in the last ~100ms as a COBS packet from the UART port. The `0x30 0x39` is the ID 12345 and a map lookup delivers the format string _`msg: %d Kelvin\n`_ and also the bit width information. Now the **trice** tool can write the target timestamp, set the message color, and execute `printf("%d Kelvin\n", 0x0000000e);`

The **trice** tool runs in the background allowing the developer to focus on programming tasks. Once an ID is generated from a string, it keeps the same ID unless the _Trice_ is changed. If for example the format string gets changed into `"msg: %d Celcius\n"`, a new ID is inserted automatically and the reference list gets extended. Obsolete IDs are kept inside the [**T**rice **I**D **L**ist](https://github.com/rokath/trice/tree/master/til.json) (`til.json`) for compatibility with older firmware versions. It could be possible when merging code, an **ID** is used twice for different format strings. In that case, the **ID** inside the reference list wins and the additional source gets patched with a new **ID**. This may be unwanted, but patching is avoidable with proper [ID management](https://github.com/rokath/trice/tree/master/docs/TriceIDManagement.md). The reference list should be kept under source code control.

## _Trice_ features

This last section of the article is digging deeper into the parts of _Trice_ which I believe developers will care most about when it comes to instrumenting embedded software.

### Open source

Target code and PC tool are open source. The MIT license gives full usage freedom. Users are invited to support further _Trice_ development.

### Easy-to-use

Making it [facile](https://github.com/rokath/trice/tree/master/docs/TriceUserGuide.md) for a user to use _Trice_ was the driving point just to have one **trice** tool and an additional source file with a project-specific simple to use `triceConfig.h` and to get away with the one macro `TRICE` for most situations. _Trice_ understands itself as a silent helper in the background to give the developer more focus on its real task. If, for example, `trice log` is running and you re-flash the target, there is **_no need to restart_** the **trice** tool. When [til.json](https://github.com/rokath/trice/tree/master/til.json) was updated in a pre-build step, the **trice** tool automatically reloads the new data during logging.

The **trice** tool comes with many command-line switches (`trice help -all`) for tailoring various needs, but mostly these are not needed. Usually, only type `trice l -p COMn` for logging with a 115200 bit/s baud rate.

### Small Size - using _Trice_ <u>frees</u> FLASH memory

Compared to a printf-library code which occupies [1](https://github.com/mludvig/mini-printf) to over [20](https://github.com/mpaland/printf#a-printf--sprintf-implementation-for-embedded-systems) KB FLASH memory, the _Trice_ code is really [small](https://github.com/rokath/trice/tree/master/docs/TriceSpace.md) - less 1 KB will do already but provide full support.

### Performance

[Can it get faster](https://github.com/rokath/trice/tree/master/docs/TriceSpeed.md)? Only 3 runtime assembly instructions per _Trice_ are needed in the minimal case! It will require more processor cycles to add timestamps and addresses, disable and enable interrupts, and increment cycle counters, but a _Trice_ call is still incredibly fast.

### Robustness with COBS Encoding

When a _Trice_ data stream is interrupted, the [COBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_Overhead_Byte_Stuffing) encoding allows an immediate re-sync with the next COBS package delimiter byte and a default _Trice_ cycle counter gives a high chance to detect lost _Trice_ messages.

Before COBS was ultimately chosen, [several encodings](https://github.com/rokath/trice/tree/master/docs/TriceObsoleteEncodings.md) were evaluated. A bonus of using COBS is the **trice** tool can include different decoders if necessary since COBS can handle multiple concurrent data streams.

### Just Like `printf` but Better

_Trice_ is usable inside interrupts and additional [format specifier support](https://github.com/rokath/trice/tree/master/docs/TriceVsPrintfSimilaritiesAndDifferences.md#Extended-format-specifier-possibilities) gives options like binary or boolean outputs. Transmitting runtime generated strings could be a need, so a `TRICE_S` macro exists supporting the `%s` format specifier for strings up to 1000 bytes long. It is possible to log float/double numbers using `%f` and the like, but the numbers need to be wrapped with the function `aFloat(x)` or `aDouble(y)`. UTF-8 encoded strings are implicitly supported if you use UTF-8 for the source code.

![]({% img_url trice/UTF-8Example.PNG %})

### Labels, Colors, and Logging Levels

You can label each _Trice_ with a channel specifier to [colorize](https://github.com/rokath/trice/tree/master/docs/TriceColor.md) the output. This is free of any runtime costs because the channel strings are part of the log format strings, which are not compiled into the target. The **trice** tool will strip full lowercase channel descriptors from the format string after setting the appropriate color, making it possible to give each letter its color.

Loggers use log levels and offer a setting like "log everything above **INFO**" for example. The _Trice_ channels implement this but can do better: Inside [emitter.ColorChannels](https://github.com/rokath/trice/tree/master/internal/emitter/lineTransformerANSI.go), all common log levels defined as _Trice_ channels can coexist with user-defined channels. The user can adjust this. The **trice** tool has the `-pick` and `-ban` switches to control the display in detail. Also a `-logLevel` switch can be used to set a display threshold as channel position inside ColorChannels.

If a target-side log level control is needed, a **trice** tool extension could each of these log level channels assign an ID range and a target-side log threshold can control which IDs are transmitted. No need to implement that right now, because the runtime and bandwidth costs are so small for each _Trice_ and a back control path is needed which is better designed by the user. Also, the [IDManagement](https://github.com/rokath/trice/tree/master/docs/TriceIDManagement.md) would get more complex.

### Compile-time Disabling of `TRICE` Macros on File Level

After debugging code in a file, there is [no need to remove or comment out `TRICE` macros](https://github.com/rokath/trice/blob/master/docs/TriceUserGuide.md#TargetsideTriceOn-Off). Write a `#define TRICE_OFF` just before the `#include "trice.h"` line and all `TRICE` macros in this file are ignored completely by the compiler, but not by the **trice** tool. In the case of re-constructing the [**T**rice **ID** **L**ist](https://github.com/rokath/trice/tree/master/til.json), these no code generating macros are regarded.

```c
//#define TRICE_OFF // uncomment this line to disable trice code generation in this file
#include "trice.h"
```

### Target and Host Timestamps

Enable target timestamps with a variable you want inside [triceConfig.h](https://github.com/rokath/trice/tree/master/test/MDK-ARM_STM32G071RB/Core/Inc/triceConfig.h). This adds a 32-bit value to each _Trice_ sequence, which can track the system clock, a millisecond timer, or another event counter. The **trice** tool will automatically recognize and display them in a default mode you can control. If several `TRICE` macros form a single line, the **trice** tool only displays the target timestamp of the first `TRICE` macro.

Embedded devices often lack a real-time clock and in some scenarios can have uptimes of weeks. Therefore the **trice** tool precedes each _Trice_ line with a PC timestamp, if not disabled. This is the _Trice_ received timestamp on the PC, which can be some milliseconds later than the target's event timestamp.

### Target Source Code Location

Some developers like to see the `filename.c` and `line` in front of each log line for quick source location. Enable this within [triceConfig.h](https://github.com/rokath/trice/tree/master/test/MDK-ARM_STM32G071RB/Core/Inc/triceConfig.h). This adds a 32-bit value to the _Trice_ sequence containing a 16-bit file ID and a 16-bit line number. The _Trice_ tool will automatically insert `#define TRICE_FILE Id(nnnnn)` with a generated file ID, and that's it!

### Multiple Target Devices in One Log Stream

Several **trice** tool instances can run in parallel or on different PCs. Each **trice** tool instance receives _Trices_ from an embedded device. Instead of displaying the log lines, the **trice** tool instances can transmit them over TCP/IP (`trice l -p COMx -ds`) to a **trice** tool instance acting as a display server (`trice ds`). The display server can interleave these log lines in one output. For each embedded device a separate _Trice_ line prefix and suffix is definable. This allows comparable time measurements in distributed systems. BTW: The _Trice_ message integration could also be done directly with the COBS packets.

### Any byte capable 1-wire connection usable

The usual _Trice_ output device is a UART but also [SEGGER-RTT](https://github.com/rokath/trice/tree/master/docs/TriceOverRTT.md) is supported over J-Link or ST-Link devices. Many microcontroller boards can act as a _Trice_ bridge to a serial port from any port ([example](https://github.com/rokath/trice/tree/master/docs/TriceOverOneWire.md)).

### Scalability

The various [_Trice_ ID management features](https://github.com/rokath/trice/tree/master/docs/TriceIDManagement.md) allow the organization also of bigger software systems. More than 65000 possible different IDs should match also large projects. Just in case: 16-bit for the ID is a not too hard changeable value.

### Portability and Modularity

The **trice** tool is written in the open source language [_Go_](https://go.dev/) and is therefore usable on many platforms. That means almost anyone can easily and automatically perform code patching and ID handling with `trice update`.

All C-compilers should be able to compile the target _Trice_ code and there is no hardware dependency despite the byte transmission. MCUs with 8-bit to 64-bit, little or big-endian are supported.

Any user program able to read a [JSON](https://github.com/rokath/trice/tree/master/til.json) file can receive the [documented](https://github.com/rokath/trice/tree/master/docs/TriceMessagesEncoding.md) _Trice_ message format, look up the ID, and perform a printf-like action to translate into log strings. The **trice** tool with its `log` switch is a working example.

Using [COBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_Overhead_Byte_Stuffing) packets starting with a [package descriptor](https://github.com/rokath/trice/tree/master/docs/TriceMessagesEncoding.md#package-mode-prefix) allows user protocols to pass over the same transmission line. The other way around is also possible! A developer could embed `Trice` messages in their own protocol.

The **trice** tool is expandable with several decoders, which means it is possible to implement a minimal _Trice_ encoding, if bandwidth matters heavily and control that with switches.

When less RAM usage is more important the target double buffer is replaceable with a FIFO using a compile-time flag. Right now, an immediate mode is selectable inside [triceConfig.h](https://github.com/rokath/trice/tree/master/test/MDK-ARM_STM32G071RB/Core/Inc/triceConfig.h) avoiding any buffer by paying a time toll.

The **trice** tool supports [many command line switches](https://github.com/rokath/trice/tree/master/docs/TriceUserGuide.md#9-options-for-trice-tool).

### Optional _Trice_ Message Encryption

The encryption opportunity makes it possible to test thoroughly a binary with log output and release it without the need to change any bit but to make the log output unreadable for a not authorized person. Implemented is the lightweight [XTEA](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Tiny_Encryption_Algorithm), which will work for many cases. It should also be easy to add a different algorithm.

## Final Words

The _Trice_ technique is new and still under development. Additional tests and bug fixes are absolutely necessary of course, but I believe it's in a solid place for anyone to try out and use! Feedback is welcome and appreciated.

Getting started with _Trice_ will take only a few hours, but will pay off during further development.
