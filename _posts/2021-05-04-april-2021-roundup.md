## Articles & Learning

- [Memfault Now Available for Free Trial](https://memfault.com/news/memfaults-device-observability-platform-now-available-for-free-trial/)<br>
  The day you've been (maybe) waiting for...Memfault now has a free-trial! We want to enable each and every professional developer to have access to the the best hardware observability tools available. We've opened up our signups, and we hope you give it a test run. Feedback is of course welcome. Want to learn more about Memfault from François himself? Sign up for the [upcoming webinar](https://hubs.ly/H0MJ0yX0) which gives an overview of Memfault's features.
- [Exploiting Undocumented Hardware Blocks in the LPC55S69 - Oxide Computer Company](https://oxide.computer/blog/lpc55/) by Laura Abbott<br>
  The NXP LPC55S69 (Cortex-M MCU) contains an undocumented hardware block that NXP could use to "patch" ROM code at runtime. It turns out anyone can write to these regions, allowing untrusted code to theoretically modify the boot sequence. Laura from Oxide Computer Company details the CVE filed and all the gory details.
- [Protection class - I2C communication issues in complex systems - IRNAS](https://www.irnas.eu/protection-class-a-solution-resolving-i2c-communication-issues-in-complex-systems/) by Vid Rajtmajer<br>
  Handling I2C failures where many devices and peripherals are connected on the same bus is a pain. Vid details a solution that IRNAS has come up with to help alleviate these issues within the firmware. 
- [LVC21-308 Essential ARM Cortex M Debugging with GDB (24m Video) - Linaro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQcp8CPjkoY) by Kevin Townsend<br>A GDB overview specifically tailored to Cortex-M devices.

- [It’s Time: InfiniTime 1.0](https://www.pine64.org/2021/04/22/its-time-infinitime-1-0/) by Jean-François Milants<br>
  This is so great. The PineTime watch has been on the Interrupt roundups for a while but never before has it seemed so...real. They've hit 1.0, the watches
  are sold out on various online stores, and they are cheap and hackable. I can't wait to see where this project goes. I can only hope there will be a PineTime "Round" to replace my Pebble Time Round.
- [Creating a stopwatch in Pinetime](https://pankajraghav.com/2021/04/03/PINETIME-STOPCLOCK.html) by Pankaj Raghav<br>
  Pankaj details how to write a simple application on a PineTime using LVGL. It looks like there's no better time to pick one up and hack away.

  M0AGX talks about the why and how to enter deep-sleep mode on an STM32 without using a vendor-provided HAL.
- [Aaron's Advice to Up-and-Coming Embedded Developers - Embedded Artistry](https://embeddedartistry.com/blog/2021/04/12/aarons-advice-to-up-and-coming-embedded-developers/) by Aaron Fontaine<br>
  We could all use advice from experienced people in the industry. Aaron shares his this time on Embedded Artistry.
- [Finding a Buffer Overflow issue using a Map File | Beningo Embedded Group](https://www.beningo.com/finding-a-buffer-overflow-issue-using-a-map-file/) by Jacob Beningo<br>
  A map file will detail the memory map of an executable, which can then be used to find which piece of memory a pointer is referencing or where a variable lives within memory. Jacob talks about using map files to debug a buffer overflow.
- [What is an Active Object? - Cove Mountain Software](https://covemountainsoftware.com/2021/04/20/what-is-an-active-object/) by Matthew Eshleman<br>

- [Parsing Protobuf at 2+GB/s: How I Learned To Love Tail Calls in C](https://blog.reverberate.org/2021/04/21/musttail-efficient-interpreters.html) by 
Josh Haberman<br>
  Josh talks about a new attribute that was recently added to Clang, `__attribute__((musttail))`, which forces a tail call to be emitted by the compiler. What is a tail call? Read on to learn more.

- [Surprisingly Slow](https://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2021/04/06/surprisingly-slow/) by Gregory Szorc<br>
  You can tell the author has spent _a ton_ of time debugging slow CI builds and other various performance issues. Here, Gregory talks about the usual suspects that anyone should know about and look into, including Python startup overhead, CMake quirks, Storage I/O performance issues, and more. 
- [The Agile Embedded Podcast](https://agileembeddedpodcast.com/)<br>

## Tools & Projects

- [Features - Electric UI](https://electricui.com/features)<br>
  A firmware library coupled with a collection of frontend components for a React application that is optimized and tailored to suit hardware devices. The firmware library communicates with the React side over a binary protocol over UART (or other transport). The company and blog also have a few neat articles, one about [hardware testing](https://electricui.com/blog/hardware-testing) and another about using [CLion with an STM32](https://electricui.com/blog/clion-stm32-setup). 
- [LIEF](https://lief.quarkslab.com/)<br>
  A library to parse and modify executable files such as ELF, PE, and MachO. 
- [labgrid-project/labgrid](https://github.com/labgrid-project/labgrid)<br>
  Python library which helps to abstract away the painful aspects of controlling hardware boards during manual and automated tests. Includes a pytest plugin for running tests remotely through SSH, allows control of power switches, and even integrates with a few OTA libraries and services. Honestly, sounds very cool. If you're thinking of writing your own home-grown automated test system, check this out first!

## Random!

- [How to make an awesome Python package in 2021](https://antonz.org/python-packaging/) by Anton Zhiyanov<br>
  The Python ecosystem has changed quite a bit in recent years, especially when it comes to packaging. We now have `setup.py` vs `pyproject.toml`, `pipenv` vs `poetry`, Tox, Black, MyPy, and many more tools. When it comes to releasing packages, there are too many things to learn about. In this post, Anton does a great job at covering the most important bits and requirements so that you can get on with your goal of releasing a PyPi package.
