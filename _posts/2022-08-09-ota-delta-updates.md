Firmware update capability has become a must-have for most devices. Whether to
add new features after launch, fix bugs, or urgently patch a security hole,
firmware updates gives modern teams the flexibility they need to move fast and
react to a changing environment.

I've written at length about firmware updates in the past, including on
Interrupt with a [Firmware Update Cookbook]({% post_url
2020-06-23-device-firmware-update-cookbook %}) and [a post about code
signing]({% post_url 2020-09-08-secure-firmware-updates-with-code-signing %}),
and even recorded a [webinar on the
topic](https://memfault.com/webinars/device-firmware-update-best-practices/).

Since then, I've heard from some of you that they've run into roadblocks
implementing firmware updates on bandwidth-limited devices. Indeed devices
connected over low bandwidth links like 900MHz wireless or LoRaWAN often
struggle to download a full firmware image in any reasonable time.

One solution is to implement _delta updates_, a technique that
allows devices to download only the bits and pieces they need rather than full
system images.

In this post, we introduce the concept of delta (i.e. partial) firmware updates,
explain why you may want to implement them in your projects and go through an
example implementation from top to bottom.

The concept behind delta updates is intuitive. When we put together a new
version of our firmware, we do not change every single line of code. Instead, we
edit specific sections of the code to change the behavior of the code and
introduce a new feature or fix a bug.

This means that our new firmware is largely made up of the old firmware, plus a
few changes.

<img width=600px src="{% img_url fwup-delta/new-code-old-image.png %}" />

Wouldn't it be neat if we could collect only the code changes and send those
down to the device, rather than the full firmware update? This is exactly what
delta updates allow us to do.

The process is broken up into two steps. First, we need to extract the bits that
have changed from our new image, we'll call it DIFF.

<img width=600px src="{% img_url fwup-delta/new-code-DIFF.png %}" />

Then we reconstruct our image from our original firmware and our delta image,
which we'll call PATCH.

<img width=700px src="{% img_url fwup-delta/new-code-PATCH.png %}" />

### Pros and Cons of Delta Updates

#### Pros

The obvious advantage of delta updates is the small size of the resulting image.
Delta images are often one to two orders of magnitude smaller than full system
images. The size reduction has multiple beneficial effects:

1. OTA updates become possible over very low bandwidth links (e.g. LoRaWAN).
2. Updates are much faster over low bandwidth links. For example, a 10MB image
   may take over 15 minutes to download over a BLE connection to a mobile phone,
   even at [peak throughput]({% post_url 2019-09-24-ble-throughput-primer %}). A
   delta update would take less than 1 minute to download, leading to a much
   better customer experience and less risk of power loss mid-update.
3. The lifetime of flash memory can be extended, as fewer writes are needed to
   install a delta image than a full image.
4. OTA consumes less power, thanks to the reduced communication and flash
   writing required.

#### Cons

However, there is no such thing as a free lunch! Delta updates come with some
downsides worth considering:

1. More complexity! Your firmware update code now needs to implement the
   patching algorithm, which creates more opportunities for bugs.
2. Delta updates require more code space to implement the patching algorithm,
   so if you are constrained already it may not be appropriate for your project.
3. Managing delta updates creates more complexity on the backend and in the
   release process.

That last point bears elaborating a bit. Unlike all system images, each delta
image is only compatible with a single original version. In other words, while a
system image for firmware v1.2.0 can upgrade any prior version to v1.2.0, a
delta update for "v1.1.0â†’v1.2.0" can only upgrade devices running v1.1.0 to
v1.2.0. As you can imagine this creates a serious challenge at the QA stage,
since the combination of things to test is much larger than with a system image.

This also means that your OTA backend needs to be sophisticated enough to
present delta updates when devices are running compatible versions, and in all
other cases present a full system update. And each firmware release requires
you to compile and upload several delta images for your versions in the
field.

> You can read more about it in our
> [documentation](https://docs.memfault.com/docs/platform/ota/#delta-releases).

### Jojodiff

One of the key components of a delta update system is a binary diff and patch
system. There are remarkably few libraries that provide this functionality. The
excellent BSDiff[^bsdiff], and XDelta[^xdelta] both require too much memory to
work on most embedded systems without modification. This leaves
Jojodiff[^jojodiff], which has been helpfully reimplemented by Jan
Jongboom[^jan] in his JanPatch library[^janpatch] optimized for embedded
systems.

While Jojodiff is neither the fastest nor the most efficient, it requires constant
space, linear time complexity, and can patch a file in place. These features
make it well suited to limited environments such as MCU-based devices.

> and BSDiff to do in-place, fixed memory delta patching. This was more effort

## Delta Updates Implementation

### Setup

Like we did in our previous posts, we use [Renode]({% post_url
2020-03-23-intro-to-renode %}) to run the examples in this post. We are using a
virtualized STM32 on which we are running a complete firmware image. The
previous post contains detailed instructions, but in short:

```
# Clone the repository & navigate to the example
$ git clone https://github.com/memfault/interrupt.git
$ cd examples/fwup-delta

# Build project and start Renode
$ make && ./start.sh
```

You can then find the Renode monitor via telnet and start the simulation:

```
$ telnet localhost 4444
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
Renode, version 1.9.0.28660 (cd1a61a4-202006301553)

(monitor) i $CWD/renode-config.resc
(STM32F429) start
Starting emulation...
(STM32F429) q
Renode is quitting
```

You can also tail the device's USART output via telnet:

```
$ telnet localhost 4445
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
Bootloader started
Valid public key
Invalid signature
Booting slot 1
Shared memory uinitialized, setting magic
Loader STARTED - version 1.0.0 (4015f0a)
Booting slot 2
App STARTED - version 1.0.1 (4015f0a) - CRC 0x1b11019d
```

### Architecture

As a reminder, this is what our device firmware update architecture looks like:

<style>
.diag4 {
    max-width: 1200px;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
}
</style>
{% blockdiag size:120x40 %}
blockdiag {
    span_width = 100;
    // Set labels to nodes.
    C [label = "Bootloader"];
    A [label = "App Loader"];
    B [label = "Application"];
    C -> A [label = "Loads", fontsize=8];
    A -> B [label = "Ld, Updt", fontsize=8];

    E [label = "Updater"];
    A -> E [label = "Ld, Updt", fontsize=8];
    E -> A [label = "Updates", fontsize=8];
    C -> E [label = "Loads", style=dashed, fontsize=8];

    group {
        label = "Slot 0";
        color = "PaleGreen";
        C;
    }
    group {
        label = "Slot 1";
        color = "LightPink";
        A;
    }
    group {
        label = "Slot 2";
        color = "LemonChiffon";
        B; E;
    }
}
{% endblockdiag %}{:.diag4}

With the following functionality for each block:

1. Bootloader: a simple program whose sole job is to load the Loader, and fall back
   to another image if the Loader is invalid.
2. Loader: a program that can verify our Application image, load it, and update
   it.
3. Application: our main code, which does not do any updates itself
4. Updater: a program that temporarily replaces the Application and can update
   the Loader.

The Loader and the Updater both may want to implement delta updates, while the
Application or the Bootloader would be mostly untouched.

### Building our Delta Update Image

First things first, let's create a new version of our firmware. As an example, I
added a print line that says "This application was patched!" at boot when our
Application runs.

To make things easy, I create a `.patch` file that I can apply and un-apply
from my codebase. I can then build my new firmware image with the following
`make` commands:

```
$(BUILD_DIR)/$(PROJECT)-app-patched.elf: $(SRCS_APP) $(PATCH_FILE) $(OPENCM3_LIB)
	# Apply patch file to the codebase
	$(GIT) apply $(PATCH_FILE)
	# Create the build folders
	$(MKDIR) -p $(BUILD_DIR)
	# Compile the ELF file for the new firmware
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS_APP) $(SRCS_APP) $(OPENCM3_LIB) -o $@
	# Un-apply the patch file
	$(GIT) apply -R $(PATCH_FILE)
```

We can then convert the image to a `.bin` file, sign it, and stick a header to
the start of it as we did in previous posts.

Now that I have my new image `app-patched.bin` and my original firmware
`app.bin`, I need to create my delta image. To do so, we can either use the
original Jojodiff or Jan's JS version, `jdiff`[^jdiff], which can be installed
via NPM (`npm install -g jdiff`). I chose the latter.

Jdiff's syntax is simple:

```
$ jdiff <base-image> <new-image> <output-patch-bin>
```

This translates to the following `make` commands:

```
$(BUILD_DIR)/patch.bin: $(BUILD_DIR)/$(PROJECT)-app.bin $(BUILD_DIR)/$(PROJECT)-app-patched.bin
	$(JDIFF) $^ $@ &>/dev/null # prints useless warning from emscripten, so ignore it
```

The resulting `patch.bin` is 1252 bytes, down from 7908 bytes for the full app
image. This is only a ~6x reduction in size but, in practice, you will see much
better results on larger and more complex applications.

Since we're not concerned with downloading the image from the cloud for the sake
of this blog post, we just hardcode the patch.bin inside of our Loader image
using `objcopy` as we explained in previous posts.

> directive which makes embedded binary and other files inside of a C program
> much easier. We'll use that instead of objcopy in the future!


### Implementing JanPatch

Janpatch is distributed as a single header file which makes it easy to integrate
into your firmware build. Simply clone the repository, stick it on your include
path, and `#include <janpatch.h>` in your C code.

Everything the library needs to work is passed via the `janpatch_ctx` struct.
Let's take a look at it:

```c
typedef struct {
    // fread/fwrite buffers
    janpatch_buffer source_buffer;
    janpatch_buffer patch_buffer;
    janpatch_buffer target_buffer;

    // function signatures
    size_t (*fread)(void*, size_t, size_t, JANPATCH_STREAM*);
    size_t (*fwrite)(const void*, size_t, size_t, JANPATCH_STREAM*);
    int    (*fseek)(JANPATCH_STREAM*, long int, int);
    long   (*ftell)(JANPATCH_STREAM*);

    // progress callback
    void   (*progress)(uint8_t);

    // the combination of the size of both the source + patch files (that's the max. the target file can be)
    long   max_file_size;
} janpatch_ctx;
```

First come the source, patch, and target buffers. These are simply RAM buffers
used by Janpatch as working memory. The author recommends matching the size of
your flash sectors for best performance, likely because the whole buffer is
written at once, so you'll save on erase times.

On our STM32, flash sectors are 4kB so we'll simply allocate three static 4kB
buffers:

```c
#include <janpatch.h>

#define SECTOR_SIZE 4096

static unsigned char source_buf[SECTOR_SIZE];
static unsigned char target_buf[SECTOR_SIZE];
static unsigned char patch_buf[SECTOR_SIZE];

int do_janpatch() {
    janpatch_ctx ctx = {
        // fread/fwrite buffers for every file, minimum size is 1 byte
        // when you run on an embedded system with block size flash, set it to the size of a block for best performance
        { source_buf, SECTOR_SIZE },
        { target_buf, SECTOR_SIZE },
        { patch_buf, SECTOR_SIZE },
	...
    };
}
```

The next four fields are function pointers that expect File I/O functions. On
POSIX systems you can simply pass `fread`, `fwrite`, and `fseek`, and define
`JANPATCH_STREAM` as `FILE`. However, we are on a bare metal system and will
need to implement our own. I'll call this module Simple File I/O or `simple_fileio`.

We need our `simple_fileio` module to be able to read data from our
memory-mapped `bin` file, and both read and write data from/to our firmware slot
in flash. We'll also need to keep track of seek offsets as we go to comply with
the POSIX-like API.

First, we'll create a new type to encapsulate all of that state and serve as our
`JANPATCH_STREAM` type. We'll call it `sfio_stream_t`:

```c
typedef enum {
    SFIO_STREAM_SLOT,
    SFIO_STREAM_RAM,
} sfio_stream_type_t;

typedef struct {
    sfio_stream_type_t type;
    size_t offset;
    size_t size;
    union {
	# RAM pointer for SFIO_STREAM_RAM
        uint8_t *ptr;
	# Image slot for SFIO_STREAM_SLOT
	image_slot_t slot;
    };
} sfio_stream_t;
```

We can then implement `sfio_fread` which reads from RAM or image slot at the
stored offset and writes it to an output pointer. Note that while the POSIX API
accepts a `size` and a `count` (for a total number of bytes read of `size *
count`, Janpatch only ever sets a size of `1` so we made the
simplifying assumption that it would always be 1.

```c
size_t sfio_fread(void *ptr, size_t size, size_t count, sfio_stream_t *stream) {
    assert(size == 1);
    if (stream->offset + count > stream->size) {
        count = stream->size - stream->offset;
    }
    if (stream->type == SFIO_STREAM_SLOT) {
        dfu_read(stream->slot, ptr, stream->offset, size * count);
    } else {
        memcpy(ptr, stream->ptr + stream->offset, size * count);
    }

    return count * size;
}
```

Next, our `sfio_fwrite` function needs to write the provided buffer of `count` bytes
to our RAM or image slot, as follows:

```c
size_t sfio_fwrite(const void *ptr, size_t size, size_t count, sfio_stream_t *stream) {
    assert(size == 1);
    if (stream->offset + count > stream->size) {
        count = stream->size - stream->offset;
    }
    if (stream->type == SFIO_STREAM_SLOT) {
        dfu_write(stream->slot, ptr, stream->offset, size * count);
    } else {
        memcpy(stream->ptr + stream->offset, ptr, size * count);
    }

    return count * size;
}
```

Last but not least, `sfio_fseek` simply needs to update the stored `offset`
value. Note that Janpatch only ever uses `SEEK_SET` so we can use that to
simplify our code again:

```c
int sfio_fseek(sfio_stream_t *stream, long int offset, int origin) {
    assert(origin == SEEK_SET);
    if (offset > stream->size) {
        return -1;
    } else {
        stream->offset = offset;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Astute readers may have noticed that we introduced new functions: `dfu_read` and
`dfu_write`, which we use to write to and read from our image slots. Those
functions convert slot addresses to physical addresses and then use memcpy or flash
APIs to read/write the data. Here's a simple implementation that does no bounds
checking;

```c
int dfu_read(image_slot_t slot, void *ptr, long int offset, size_t count) {
    void *addr = (slot == IMAGE_SLOT_1 ? &__slot1rom_start__ : &__slot2rom_start__);
    addr += offset;
    memcpy(ptr, addr, count);
    return count;
}

int dfu_write(image_slot_t slot, const void *ptr, long int offset, size_t count) {
    uint32_t addr = (uint32_t)(slot == IMAGE_SLOT_1 ? &__slot1rom_start__ : &__slot2rom_start__);
    addr += offset;
    flash_program(addr, ptr, count);
    return count;
}
```

We can now fill in our `janpatch_ctx`:

```c
#define SECTOR_SIZE 4096

janpatch_ctx ctx = {
    // fread/fwrite buffers for every file, minimum size is 1 byte
    // when you run on an embedded system with block size flash, set it to the size of a block for best performance
    { source_buf, SECTOR_SIZE },
    { target_buf, SECTOR_SIZE },
    { patch_buf, SECTOR_SIZE },

    // functions which can perform basic IO
    &sfio_fread,
    &sfio_fwrite,
    &sfio_fseek,

    NULL, // ftell not implemented
    NULL, // progress callback not implemented
};
```

Finally, we need to invoke the `janpatch` method itself. It acccepts three
`JANPATCH_STREAM`:

- `source`, here that is our App image in slot 2.
- `patch`, the delta image we hardcoded into our Loader (i.e. memory mapped)
- `target`, also our App image in slot 2, as we are patching in-place.

Here is what the code looks like:

```c
    JANPATCH_STREAM source = {
        .type = SFIO_STREAM_SLOT,
	.offset = 0,
	.size = (size_t)&__slot2rom_size__,
	.slot = IMAGE_SLOT_2,
    };
    JANPATCH_STREAM patch = {
        .type = SFIO_STREAM_RAM,
	.offset = 0,
	.size = (size_t)&_binary_build_patch_bin_size,
	.ptr = data_ptr,
    };
    JANPATCH_STREAM target = {
        .type = SFIO_STREAM_SLOT,
	.offset = 0,
	.size = (size_t)&__slot2rom_size__,
	.slot = IMAGE_SLOT_2,
    };

    shell_put_line("Patching data");
    janpatch(ctx, &source, &patch, &target);
```

That's it! The full example is available on Github in [the Interrupt
repo](https://github.com/memfault/interrupt/tree/master/example/fwup-delta).

### Testing it all in Renode

Once we've built all of our image, we simply need to start Renode by running the
provided `start.sh` or `mono64 Renode.exe renode-config.resc --port 4444
--disable-xwt`.

We then perform the update on the USART console:

```
âžœ  ~ telnet localhost 4445
Trying ::1...
telnet: connect to address ::1: Connection refused
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
Bootloader started
Booting slot 1
Shared memory initialized, setting magic
Loader STARTED - version 1.0.0 (01b2209)

shell> dfu-mode
Rebooting into DFU mode
Bootloader started

Loader STARTED - version 1.0.0 (01b2209)
Entering DFU Mode

shell> do-dfu

Booting slot 2
App STARTED - version 1.0.1 (01b2209) - CRC 0xea1a3793

shell> This application was patched! <--- It worked!
```

We can see "This application was patched!" print after the update (but not
before). Everything is working!

## Conclusion

With the help of some great open source software, implementing delta updates in
our Loader turned out to be relatively easy. A huge thanks especially to Jan
Jongboom for his reverse engineering of the jojodiff format and implementation
of an embedded-friendly patch library.

A separate post could be written about how to wrangle those updates on the
cloud side. Getting the right binary to the right device becomes more
complicated as we roll out features like Delta Updates. Perhaps we will tackle
this topic next time.

As always, we'd love to hear from you. Do you use a different approach to delta
updates? Let us know! And if you see anything you'd like to change, don't
hesitate to submit a pull request or open an issue on
