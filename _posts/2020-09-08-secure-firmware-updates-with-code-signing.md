[Previously]({% post_url 2020-06-23-device-firmware-update-cookbook %}), we
wrote about implementing firmware update for our devices. One important detail
we did not cover is firmware update security.

Much can be done - and written - about firmware update security, but perhaps the
most important bit is firmware signing. Other security measures are not much use
if we cannot verify the authenticity of a firmware update!

<!-- excerpt start -->
In this post, we explain why firmware signing is important, how it works, and
what algorithm should be used to implement it. We also detail a full
implementation built with open source, cross platform libraries.

Code signing is a method of proving a file was created by a trusted source and
has not been tampered with. This is achieved by creating a signature for the
file: a token which can be verified but not forged.

We all use signatures in our day to day life, by scribbling our name at the
bottom of our credit card receipts, contracts, and bank checks. These signatures
can be verified quite easily by comparing them to previous signatures, but are
hard to forge because they rely on an individual's muscle memory.

Code signing uses cryptographic algorithms to achieve a similar goal. The
resulting signatures can only be generated by people who know a given password,
also known as a secret key, but can be verified as genuine by anyone.

When a signature is generated for a firmware binary, it is uniquely tied to that
exact firmware. Changing the binary so much as 1 bit would produce a different
signature.

With this in mind, if a device is given a signed binary and a signature and can
verify both that the binary and signature are valid and that the binary was
created by the correct author, then we know the binary has not been tampered
with.

### Why sign our firmware

By implementing signature verification in our bootloader we can identify
whether or not a given firmware update was provided by the manufacturer, or if
it has been tampered with. The bootloader can then decide to either warn the
user, void the device's warranty, or simply refuse to run the unauthenticated
binary.

With more and more devices connected to the internet, security is an
increasingly hot topic in firmware development. A device which accepts firmware
updates over the wireless or internet connectivity but does not verify it opens
itself to compromise. By feeding it with a malicious firmware image, an attacker
might:
* Brick the device, or the whole fleet
* Snoop on end users and compromise their privacy and security
* Strategically malfunction at a critical time

These are highly undesirable outcomes, which can be effected at scale due to the
internet of things. In 2020, it is reckless to implement firmware update for our
systems without some form of authentication.

### ECDSA

Several algorithms can be used to sign firmware, including RSA, DSA, and ECDSA.
In this post, we focus on ECDSA for a few reasons:

1. Security: ECDSA is the latest and greatest in terms of signature algorithms.
   While standard DSA is considered broken by most, ECDSA is expected to remain
secure until quantum computing becomes widely available.
2. Popularity: ECDSA is used extensively in applications ranging from
   cryptocurrencies (bitcoin) to secure messaging. With popularity comes battle
tested implementations and credibility.
3. Availability: Open source implementations of ECDSA are available for
   microcontrollers, including mbedtls[^mbedtls], wolfssl[^wolfssl], and
micro-ecc.
4. Small Footprint: ECDSA implementations are very small (single digit kB), and
   require smaller keys than RSA or DSA for similar levels of security. This
saves both code space and RAM and makes ECDSA well suited to embedded
environments.

Understanding the math behind ECDSA is outside of the scope of this article, but
here is a high level overview of how the process works:
1. A cryptographic hash of the firmware  binary is created. Any cryptographic
   hashing algorithm should work, though SHA-2 family hashes are recommended. In
the case of SHA-256, this yields a 32-byte number.
2. A signature is generated using a private key and the cryptographic hash.
   This signature is distributed alongside the firmware and a public key. The
signature may not be deterministic, so don't fret if multiple invocations of
your ECDSA code yield different signatures. This signature is a pair of
integers, each 32 bytes long.
3. To verify the binary, a SHA-256 hash is once again computed for our firmware
   binary.
4. The public key and the hash can be used to verify the signature was generated
   using matching inputs.

## Firmware Signing Implementation

Our implementation builds upon the code we wrote for our [firmware update
architecture post]({% post_url 2020-06-23-device-firmware-update-cookbook%} ).
You may find that code on Github at [interrupt@20ec4ba](https://github.com/memfault/interrupt/tree/20ec4ba2d0def6214aa808717446cdbaced1c352/example/fwup-architecture).

### Setup

Like we did our previous post, the [Firmware Update Cookbook]({% post_url 2020-06-23-device-firmware-update-cookbook%}), we use [Renode]({% post_url
2020-03-23-intro-to-renode %}) to run the examples in this post. The previous post contains detailed instructions, but in short:

```
# Clone the repository & navigate to the example
$ git clone https://github.com/memfault/interrupt.git
$ cd examples/fwup-signing

# Build project and start Renode
$ make && ./start.sh
```

One change we did make from previous posts is run in headless mode. This is done
by invoking Renode with the following flags:

```
mono64 $RENODE_EXE_PATH renode-config.resc --port 4444 --disable-xwt
```

We can then use telnet to connect to the Renode console:

```
$ telnet localhost 4444
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
Renode, version 1.9.0.28660 (cd1a61a4-202006301553)

(monitor) i $CWD/renode-config.resc
(STM32F429) start
Starting emulation...
(STM32F429) q
Renode is quitting
```

Similarly, we route the device UART to a telnet port rather than a graphical
window by adding two lines to our `renode-config.resc`:

```
emulation CreateServerSocketTerminal 4445 "externalUART"
connector Connect sysbus.uart2 externalUART
```

We can then access our emulated device's UART via telnet as well:

```
$ telnet localhost 4445
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
Bootloader started
Valid public key
Invalid signature
Booting slot 1
Shared memory uinitialized, setting magic
Loader STARTED - version 1.0.0 (4015f0a)
Booting slot 2
App STARTED - version 1.0.1 (4015f0a) - CRC 0x1b11019d
```

### Architecture

As a reminder, this is what our device firmware update architecture looks like:

<style>
.diag4 {
    max-width: 1200px;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
}
</style>
{% blockdiag size:120x40 %}
blockdiag {
    span_width = 100;
    // Set labels to nodes.
    C [label = "Bootloader"];
    A [label = "App Loader"];
    B [label = "Application"];
    C -> A [label = "Loads", fontsize=8];
    A -> B [label = "Ld, Updt", fontsize=8];

    E [label = "Updater"];
    A -> E [label = "Ld, Updt", fontsize=8];
    E -> A [label = "Updates", fontsize=8];
    C -> E [label = "Loads", style=dashed, fontsize=8];

    group {
        label = "Slot 0";
        color = "PaleGreen";
        C;
    }
    group {
        label = "Slot 1";
        color = "LightPink";
        A;
    }
    group {
        label = "Slot 2";
        color = "LemonChiffon";
        B; E;
    }
}
{% endblockdiag %}{:.diag4}

With the following functionality for each block:

1. Bootloader: a simple program whose sole job is to load the Loader, and fallback
   to another image if the Loader is invalid.
2. Loader: a program that can verify our Application image, load it, and update
   it.
3. Application: our main code, which does not do any updates itself
4. Updater: a program that temporarily replaces the Application and can update
   the Loader.

The Loader, the Application, and the Updater all need to be signed since they
can be updated. Components that update other components need to implement our
signature verification algorithm, in our case that's the Loader and the Updater.

### Generating public/private key pairs

Before we can begin, we must generate a pair of keys. Our **private key**, also
known as a **signing key**, is used to create the signatures, and should be kept
private. Anyone with access to the key will be able to sign firmware on your
behalf. Our **public key**, also known as a **validation key**, is used to verify
the signature. It can be freely distributed.

Several tools can be used to generate our key pair but the simplest is
`openssl`, a cross platform cryptography toolset.

First, we generate our private key:
```bash
$ openssl ecparam -name secp256k1 -genkey -noout -out private.pem
```

Then we create a public key to go with this private key:
```bash
$ openssl ec -in private.pem -pubout -out public.pem
```

At this point we should have two files: `public.pem` and `private.pem`.

We can test the sign/verify flow with openssl as well. To sign a file we do:

```bash
$ openssl dgst -sha256 -sign private.pem -out build/fwup-example.bin.sig build/fwup-example.bin
```

Where "fwup-example.bin" is the file we want to sign, and "fwup-example.bin.sig"
is the signature file we want to create.

The signature can then be verified with:

```bash
$ openssl dgst -sha256 -verify public.pem -signature build/fwup-example.bin.sig build/fwup-example.bin
Verified OK
```

That's it! We've got keys we can use to sign and verify firmware builds!

### Bundling signatures with our builds

Next we must add the signing step to our build and add the signatures to our
image. The latter is easy to do: we already have a metadata for our images saved
into the `image_hdr_t`. We simply add a field for the signature and increment
our metadata version:

```diff
 typedef enum {
     IMAGE_VERSION_1 = 1,
-    IMAGE_VERSION_CURRENT = IMAGE_VERSION_1,
+    IMAGE_VERSION_2 = 2,
+    IMAGE_VERSION_CURRENT = IMAGE_VERSION_2,
 } image_version_t;

 typedef struct __attribute__((packed)) {
@@ -34,10 +35,13 @@
     uint32_t vector_addr;
     uint32_t reserved;
     char git_sha[8];
+    uint8_t ecdsa_sig[64];
 } image_hdr_t;
```

The 64 bytes contain the two integers that make up our signature one after the
other.

We then modify `patch_image_header.py` so that it generates and appends the
signature to our binary. Rather than shell out to `openssl`, we use a native
Python library that implements ECDSA. Simply enough, it is called `ecdsa`.

Generating the signature can be accomplished with a few lines of code:

```python
import hashlib
from ecdsa import SigningKey
from ecdsa.util import sigencode_string
from binascii import hexlify


def gen_binary_signature(data, key_filename):
    with open(key_filename, "r") as f:
        key_pem = f.read()
    key = SigningKey.from_pem(key_pem)
    sig = key.sign_deterministic(data, hashfunc=hashlib.sha256, sigencode=sigencode_string)
    return sig
```

A few things to note:
1. We use SHA-256 as our hashing function, so we must specify it when we
   generate the signature
2. The `sigencode` parameter is used to specify the format of the signature. By
   default, a DER file a generated (this is what openssl uses as well), but by
using `sigencode_string` we tell the library to generate a flat string that
contains the binary representation of both signature integers one after another.
This is a simpler format and will save us from implementing a DER parser in
our firmware.

We then update our `patch_binary_payload` function to invoke
`gen_binary_signature`:

```diff
+def patch_binary_payload(bin_filename, pk_filename):

Since the script now takes an argument, we must modify our Makefile as well

Where `PK_PEM_PATH` is the path to your private key.<!-- TODO: Add a note about
security -->

We now have a build process that generates signed binaries!

### Verifying signatures in our Loader

Now that our firmware builds are signed, let's verify those signatures in our
Loader!

Remember that the process takes two steps:
1. Compute the SHA-256 hash of our firmware binary
2. Verify the signature with the hash and the public key

First, we'll need an implementation of the ECDSA algorithm. Remember, the first
rule of crypto is "don't roll your own crypto" so you'll want a battle-tested
library implemented by experts. There are a few good options, but we chose
micro-ecc[^micro-ecc] as we are most familiar with it and it is extremely small.

micro-ecc is extremely easy to add to a project: it consists of a single
`.c` (uECC.c) and a single `.h` (uECC.h) file. Add the source file to your list of sources, and
the header file to your include path.

We then add our public key to our firmware. micro-ecc expects our keys to be
"represented in standard format, but without the 0x04
prefix"[^micro-ecc-representation]. We can use `openssl` to get the raw key
data:

```shell
(.venv) $ openssl ec -in private.pem -text -noout
read EC key
Private-Key: (256 bit)
priv:
    4f:93:5d:53:41:82:21:91:11:e9:fe:9f:33:90:09:
    28:da:d0:96:70:f7:5e:26:85:dc:ff:5d:bc:f8:6f:
    5f:15
pub:
    04:d0:e6:a7:a5:4e:33:0e:bb:d9:9e:e6:8f:59:ff:
    b6:c1:19:76:28:60:88:16:6a:17:8b:7b:e0:66:cf:
    7b:71:0d:f5:cc:95:76:22:ae:0e:a4:ef:49:bd:07:
    2a:71:49:84:49:78:eb:34:e5:78:b3:a7:96:48:89:
    7c:4f:d1:7e:a5
ASN1 OID: secp256k1
```

We take the `pub` section, remove the leading `04` bytes, and translate it to a
C array:

```c
static const uint8_t PUBKEY[] = {
  0xd0, 0xe6, 0xa7, 0xa5, 0x4e, 0x33, 0x0e, 0xbb, 0xd9, 0x9e, 0xe6, 0x8f, 0x59,
  0xff, 0xb6, 0xc1, 0x19, 0x76, 0x28, 0x60, 0x88, 0x16, 0x6a, 0x17, 0x8b, 0x7b,
  0xe0, 0x66, 0xcf, 0x7b, 0x71, 0x0d, 0xf5, 0xcc, 0x95, 0x76, 0x22, 0xae, 0x0e,
  0xa4, 0xef, 0x49, 0xbd, 0x07, 0x2a, 0x71, 0x49, 0x84, 0x49, 0x78, 0xeb, 0x34,
  0xe5, 0x78, 0xb3, 0xa7, 0x96, 0x48, 0x89, 0x7c, 0x4f, 0xd1, 0x7e, 0xa5
  // 64 bytes
};
```

We can then verify that uECC is able to read the key correctly by calling
`uECC_valid_public_key`. We add the following code somewhere in our `main`
function at boot:

```c
#include <micro-ecc/uECC.h>

const struct uECC_Curve_t *curve = uECC_secp256k1();
if (!uECC_valid_public_key(PUBKEY, curve)) {
    printf("Public key is NOT valid\n");
} else {
    printf("Public key is valid\n");
}
```

Note that we had to select the same curve we used to generate the key, here
`secp2561k`.

Last but not least, we need to verify the signature itself. This requires
computing the SHA-256, and using `uECC_verify`.

Many MCUs have hardware implementations of SHA-256, but in our case, we used a
software implementation provided by a library called CIFRA[^cifra]. We only need
to add two files from CIFRA to our build: `cifra/src/sha256.c` and `cifra/src/blockwise.c`,
as well as two paths to our include path: `cifra/src` and `cifra/src/ext`.

With that, I implemented a simple sha256 wrapper function which computes the
hash of a given buffer:

```c
static void prv_sha256(const void *buf, uint32_t size, uint8_t *hash_out)
{
  cf_sha256_context ctx;
  cf_sha256_init(&ctx);
  cf_sha256_update(&ctx, buf, size);
  cf_sha256_digest_final(&ctx, hash_out);
}
```

Note that `cf_sha256_update` can be called mutliple times, so if you are
validating a binary that isn't memory mapped you can calculate the hash
iteratively rather than all at once. For example, here's an implementation that
reads from a POSIX file:

```c
static void prv_sha256(FILE *fp, uint8_t *hash_out)
{
  #define READ_BUF_SZ 128
  static uint8_t read_buf[READ_BUF_SZ] = {0};

  cf_sha256_context ctx;
  cf_sha256_init(&ctx);

  fseek(fp, sizeof(image_hdr_t), SEEK_SET);
  size_t readsize = 0;
  while ((readsize = fread(read_buf, 1, READ_BUF_SZ, fp)) > 0) {
    cf_sha256_update(&ctx, read_buf, readsize);
  }

  cf_sha256_digest_final(&ctx, hash_out);
}
```

Given a hash and a public key, we can then validate the signature found in our
`imaget_hdr_t`:

```c
if (!uECC_verify(PUBKEY, hash, CF_SHA256_HASHSZ, hdr->ecdsa_sig, curve)) {
    printf("Signature is NOT valid\n");
} else {
    printf("Signature is valid\n");
}
```

Putting it all together, here's our function to verify the signature of a given
image:

```c
int image_check_signature(image_slot_t slot, const image_hdr_t *hdr) {
    void *addr = (slot == IMAGE_SLOT_1 ? &__slot1rom_start__ : &__slot2rom_start__);
    addr += sizeof(image_hdr_t);
    uint32_t len = hdr->data_size;

    uint8_t hash[CF_SHA256_HASHSZ];
    prv_sha256(addr, len, hash);

    const struct uECC_Curve_t *curve = uECC_secp256k1();
    if (!uECC_valid_public_key(PUBKEY, curve)) {
        return -1;
    }

    if (!uECC_verify(PUBKEY, hash, CF_SHA256_HASHSZ, hdr->ecdsa_sig, curve)) {
        return -1;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

We can invoke that function as part of our OTA process in
`loader_shell_commands.c`:

```diff

         return -1;
     }

     if (dfu_commit_image(IMAGE_SLOT_2, hdr)) {

Running our firmware, we can watch it all happen over serial:

```shell

## Additional Considerations

### Key Storage

Your firmware signing process is only as secure as your key storage mechanism.
Since the private key can be used to create build that look like they are coming
from you, it is important to keep it private.

Your key storage system needs to:
1. Put the key out of reach of most employees / partners
2. Make it easy to sign a release build you actually want signed
3. Be resilient. If you lose the key, you won't be able to distribute additional
   firmware updates.

Unfortunately, this is not easy to do. Many people simply store their private
key alongside their source code, in their git repoitory. Do not do this! It
fails to meet rule (1) and is considered poor practice (in fact, Github will
warn you if it detects something that looks like a private key in your
repository).

Instead, it is better to store your key alongside your [CI system]({% post_url
2019-09-17-continuous-integration-for-firmware %}) and let it handle signing of
release builds. Make sure only select users have access to the private key, by
restricting permissions in your CI system. Most systems support this use case
one way or another. For example, CircleCI offers [Restricted
Contexts](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/contexts/#restricting-a-context) which
can be set up such that only administrator level users can see a private key,
and their approval is needed to trigger a release build.

You may take key storage a step further and use a specialized Secrets Management
Systems such as Hashicorp Vault[^vault] or Amazon Key Management Service[^kms].
These are systems that offer secure secret storage with complex access control
lists and API integrations.

Last but not least, make sure to securely store a backup of your keys somewhere.
Whether on paper, on a smartcard, or on an airgapped system, your offline
backups should be inaccessible most of the time.

### Key Rotation

In the event a private key gets compromised, we need the ability to rotate it.
This involves generating a new public / private key pair, and updating the
public key hardcoded in the firmware.  Thankfully, this is a relatively simple
process with our current architecture. Since the public key is hardcoded in
updateable components, we simply update them!

Here are the step-by-step details:
1. Generate a new private/public key pair with `openssl`
2. Hardcode  the new public key in our Updater and Loader firmware
3. Build a new Updater, sign it with the *old* private key
4. Build a new Loader, sign it with the *new* private key
5. Build a new Application, sign it with the *new* private key
6. Load the new Updater on your devices. Because it is signed with the old key,
   the current Loader will accept it.
7. Load the new Loader on your devices via the new Updater
8. Load the new Application on your devices via the new Loader

As you see, this is the same process we'd use to update the Loader for any other
reason.

### Development Keys

Since we've taken great pains to make sure our engineers do *not* have direct
access to the key, how can we enable them to load custom firmware images on
their development devices?

We need a set of development keys which are used for that use case only. All
development systems have the development public key hardcoded in rather than the
production key. The development private key can only be used to sign firmware
for these development systems, so it isn't sensitive and can be stored in the
repository.

Production systems should continue to use the production key, and will not
accept firmware signed with the development key. In the event we want to load a
development build on a production system - say, for debugging - we load a
special Loader on it which is signed with the production key but contains the
development key. This special Loader must be safeguarded: it downgrades
verification on a production system to an insecure key.

## Closing

Hope this post has convinced you that firmware signing can be implemented
relatively simply, and that there are important benefits to doing so.

There is much more we could do to secure our firmware update process. For
example, we should make sure we lock our flash when our application is running
to avoid an bug in our firmware being used to modify it. We also should consider
a more robust mechanism to "unlock" than our special Loader with development
keys.

These will perhaps be topics for future blog posts :-).

As always, we'd love to hear from you. How do you secure your firmware update
process? Let us know! And if you see anything you'd like to change, don't
