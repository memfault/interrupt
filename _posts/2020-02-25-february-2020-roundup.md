* [Opening up the Baseboard Management Controller](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3378404) by Jessie Frazelle - Covers the state of the open source ecosystem for Baseboard Management Controllers.
* [Permanent storage using EEPROM](http://lucstechblog.blogspot.com/2020/01/permanent-storage-using-eeprom.html) by Luc Volders - Introduction to using the EEPROM on an Arduino device to retain state between reboots.
* [Moving Embedded Projects to CMake](https://dornerworks.com/blog/moving-embedded-projects-to-cmake) by Nicholas Pahl - Introduction to structuring and building embedded projects using CMake.
* [RISC-V Software Ecosystem Overview](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-software-list) - Github README that details the state of the RISC-V software ecosystem.
* [Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org/) - Neat tool which takes in source and prints assembly for an extensive list of compilers. Great for when trying to optimize code size and squeeze a few extra bytes. 
* [The Importance of Deep Work & The 30-Hour Method for Learning a New Skill](https://azeria-labs.com/the-importance-of-deep-work-the-30-hour-method-for-learning-a-new-skill/) by Azeria - An article which starts by detailing how to learn a new skill, and uses ARM Exploitation as an example "new skill" to learn.
* [IoT talks from FOSDEM'20](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/track/internet_of_things/) - Collection of interesting talks, some related to embedded.
* [Reverse Engineering my router with `binwalk`](https://embeddedbits.org/reverse-engineering-router-firmware-with-binwalk/) by Sergio Prado
* [Embedded Rust Blog Posts](https://josh.robsonchase.com/embedded-frustrations/) by Josh Robson Chase
* [Apollo 11 Computer vs. USB-C Chargers](https://forrestheller.com/Apollo-11-Computer-vs-USB-C-chargers.html) by Forest Heller
* [Emulating A Bluetooth Keyboard With The ESP32](https://hackaday.com/2020/02/13/emulating-a-bluetooth-keyboard-with-the-esp32/) by Tom Nardi

## Neat Open Source Projects

* [Anchor](https://github.com/rideskip/anchor) by Skip Transport - Open-source collection of embedded firmware libraries created by the team at Skip Transport, the company behind Skip Scooters. Libraries included today include a logging, Finite State Machine, and console CLI library (!).
* [Delta Encoding Tools - detools](https://github.com/eerimoq/detools) - Python library to assist with incremental binary diff'ing which supports the Cortex-M4 architecture. Ideal use case is OTA updates.
* [Swift Embedded](https://github.com/swift-embedded/swift-embedded) - Project that is bringing Swift to microcontrollers. "A 'hello world' application has a little bit over 1MB because it includes a big part of the Swift standard library.
* [Rust on Zephyr](https://github.com/tylerwhall/zephyr-rust) - API bindings, libstd, and Cargo integration for running Rust applications on a Zephyr kernel.
* [TamaGo - bare metal Go for ARM SoCs](https://github.com/f-secure-foundry/tamago) - project that aims to provide compilation and execution of unencumbered Go applications for bare metal ARM SOCs.
