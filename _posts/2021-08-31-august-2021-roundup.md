> You may have noticed there was no July roundup. We've been busy improving [Memfault](https://memfault.com), building out our partnerships with [Nordic Semiconductor](https://memfault.com/news/monitoring-debugging-and-updating-nordic-powered-iot-products-made-easy-with-device-observability-platform-partnership/) and [Laird](https://memfault.com/news/laird-connectivity-partners-with-memfault-to-offer-device-observability-platform-for-its-connected-low-power-cellular-bluetooth-product-line/), and enjoying the summer months. Thanks for understanding.

Here are the articles, videos, and tools that we've been excited about this
July and August.

We hope you enjoy these links, and we look forward to hearing what you've been
reading in the comments or [on the Interrupt Slack](https://interrupt-slack.herokuapp.com/).

## Articles & Learning

- [CMake Part 3 - Source File Organisation - Sticky Bits](https://blog.feabhas.com/2021/08/cmake-part-3-source-file-organisation/) by Martin Bond<br>
  A great introduction series to using CMake to cross-compile a firmware for an STM32F4 MCU. This post covers how to structure source files and build them into object and static files. Be sure to check out Part 1 and Part 2!
- [Rust on Espressif chips](https://mabez.dev/blog/posts/esp-rust-espressif/) by Scott Mabin<br>Scott recounts his experiences of working with ESP32 chips and Rust. There's a [ESP-IDF hello world Rust application](https://github.com/ivmarkov/rust-esp32-std-hello) that connects to Wi-Fi, has a GUI, and using many of the ESP-IDF standard library functions, all using Rust. I also learned about [esp-rs](https://github.com/esp-rs), a project to help bring Rust to the Espressif ecosystem.
- [Exploring Clang/LLVM optimization on programming horror](https://blog.matthieud.me/2020/exploring-clang-llvm-optimization-on-programming-horror/) by Matthieu<br>Matthieu dives into the deep end and investigates how LLVM (and GCC fails to) optimize a simple looping function into a constant time algorithm that is even shorter in assembly than in C(++).
- [Resolving I2C Address Conflicts](https://embeddedartistry.com/blog/2021/08/02/resolving-i2c-address-conflicts/) by Phillip Johnston<br>
  I2C address conflicts occur when two parts communicate over I2C using the same address. Phillip provides a simple and succinct list of options for how to work around them.
- [From Stolen Laptop to Inside the Company Network | Dolos Group](https://dolosgroup.io/blog/2021/7/9/from-stolen-laptop-to-inside-the-company-network)<br>
  The bit I learned from this article is that you can listen over SPI and capture a Bitlocker decryption key using the Saleae Logic analyzer, [bitlocker-spi-toolkit](https://github.com/FSecureLABS/bitlocker-spi-toolkit). Fascinating.
- [The Monkey Island PC-Speaker music player](https://www.thanassis.space/monkeyisland.html) by Athanasios Tsiodras<br>
  Athanasios encoded all the songs from Monkey Island using Huffman compression, stored them on an ATtiny85, and played them over a tiny speaker. A nice mixture of C Arduino code and a bunch of Pythons scripting!
- [RISC-V: A Baremetal Introduction Using C++](https://philmulholland.medium.com/modern-c-for-bare-metal-risc-v-zero-to-blink-part-1-intro-def46973cbe7) by Phil Mulholland<br>
  An 8 part series on Modern C++ RISC-V bare-metal programming.
- [WebSerial - Read from and write to a serial port](https://web.dev/serial/) by FranÃ§ois Beaufort<br>
  A series of code snippets explaining how to use the browser's WebSerial API to read and write to and from a device's serial port (think UART). I believe there is huge potential in interfacing with devices using WebUSB and WebSerial, especially around automated testing and debugging. Reach out if you've done anything you think is fun!
- [Reverse Engineering WiFi on RISC-V BL602](https://lupyuen.github.io/articles/wifi) by Lee Lup Yuen<br>
  The Bouffalo Labs BL602 comes pre-loaded with a closed-source Wi-Fi driver. In this novel of a post, Lee Lup Yuen reverse engineers the BL602 Wi-Fi driver to confirm it's performing as expected. It turns out it contains a lot of open-source code which can be found in various projects, such as AliOS, the Rockchip RK3399 Wi-Fi driver, LWIP, mbedTLS, and FreeRTOS.
- [Semantic Versioning on Github | Stratify Labs](https://blog.stratifylabs.co/device/2021-07-12-Semantic-Versioning-and-Github)<br>
  A best-practices article on how to branch and version for firmware using Git. It describes cherry-picking, semantic versions, and changelogs.
- [What Every C Programmer Should Know About Undefined Behavior #1/3 | The LLVM Project Blog](https://blog.llvm.org/2011/05/what-every-c-programmer-should-know.html) by Chris Lattner<br>
  Chris goes over various ways to cause an LLVM-compiled program to crash and produce undefined behavior, such as integer overflow, dereferencing a null pointer, etc. I believe it's good to know what _not_ to do as well as _what to do_.
- [Embedded Cross-Compiled Test Driven Development with CGull | lack of focus](https://www.louissimons.com/embedded-cross-compiled-tdd) by Lou Simons<br>
  One of the annoying parts of embedded unit testing is that the libraries and frameworks usually don't come with a "runner". You have to craft your own using Make, CMake, or use Ceedling (but it's Ruby, which I don't love). Lou talks about how to test code using Unity and CGull as the runner.

## Tools & Projects

- [martin-ger/esp32_nat_router: ESP32 NAT Router | GitHub](https://github.com/martin-ger/esp32_nat_router)<br>
  The projects people build on ESP32's are getting out of hand ðŸ˜œ. I had never heard of someone building a router on such a limited device before this.
- [reproducible-builds/disorderfs - FUSE filesystem that introduces non-determinism](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/disorderfs)<br>
  The [Reproducible Builds](https://reproducible-builds.org/) group is a heavy advocate of exactly that. This project hosts your source files in a FUSE-compatible file system and randomizes the order in which they are returned to the compiler to ensure that you aren't accidentally relying on the filesystem layout for reproducible builds. I love the creativity here.
- [walmis/blackmagic-espidf: Blackmagic Wireless SWD Debug probe hosted on ESP-IDF SDK | GitHub](https://github.com/walmis/blackmagic-espidf)<br>
  With this project, you can flash your ESP8266, debug it, and retrieve logs over Wi-Fi and GDB.
- [Manawyrm/fxIP: fxIP - TCP/IP for Casio fx-9860 graphical calculators](https://github.com/Manawyrm/fxIP)<br>For a brief moment, this website was hosted on a Casio graphic calculator using this webserver. Since then, the webserver has since been taken down but it's now on the [Web Archive](http://web.archive.org/web/20210712193555/http://fxip.as203478.net/).
- [superlou/cgull: Minimal tool for testing embedded C using Python and Unity](https://github.com/superlou/cgull)<br>
  Mentioned above in the articles section, but placed this here as well because I really like it!

## Random

- [C Programming - The State of Developer Ecosystem in 2021 Infographic | JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2021/c/)<br>
  A fun survey of developers done by the JetBrains team about favorite languages, tools, compilers, and package managers. I've linked the C survey, but check the others out!
- [WE ARE UPDATING YOUR SHOES | Twitter](https://twitter.com/avagliano_alex/status/1387095139508703233)<br>
  Are you all ready for your shoes to have firmware updates? Because it's happening. First with Nike. Now with Under Armour.
- [ZeroVer: 0-based Versioning](https://0ver.org/)<br>
  This is too funny but all too real. Some projects have been around for _years_ and will likely never increment to version 1.0.
