  Low cost WiFi HaLoW development board. I haven't seen a lot of adoption of the
  WiFi HaLoW (802.11ah) standard yet, but it's a really interesting connectivity
  standard, and I'm excited to see it grow! — Noah

- [**Reverse Engineering a Smartwatch | Benjamen Lim**](https://medium.com/csg-govtech/reverse-engineering-a-smartwatch-a7cec52b29c8)<br>
