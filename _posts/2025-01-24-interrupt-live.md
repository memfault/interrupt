The Interrupt community was developed by Memfault as a meeting place for
engineers, hobbyists, and enthusiasts to share debugging war stories, uncover
new workarounds, build on the latest technology, and celebrate their most
triumphant wins. Yes, we aim to push embedded engineering forward, but more
importantly, we want to showcase the brilliant minds that make this field so
dynamic.

<!-- excerpt start -->

After nearly seven years of Interrupt contributions, we‚Äôve decided to take this
conversation to the next level. Introducing Interrupt Live: a YouTube Live
series where we sit down with Interrupters to hear more about their origin
stories, engineering journeys, and the unique challenges that inspired their
contributions. If you‚Äôve ever wanted to hear directly from the engineers behind
your favorite Interrupt posts, now‚Äôs your chance.

<!-- excerpt end -->

During these quick, 20-minute live sessions, we‚Äôll get to know our contributors
up close, ask them anything, and virtually throw tomatoes at our co-founder and
host, [Tyler Hoffman](https://interrupt.memfault.com/authors/tyler/). Expect
unscripted conversations and candid discussions with real-world embedded
engineers.

üìÖ Join us for the inaugural episode on
[Thursday, January 30, 2025, at 10:30 AM ET | 7:30 AM PT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPFhUrQa1bs).
We‚Äôll meet [Noah Pendleton](https://interrupt.memfault.com/authors/noah), MCU
SDK Engineer at Memfault. Find us on
