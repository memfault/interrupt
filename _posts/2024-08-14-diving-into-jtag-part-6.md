<!-- excerpt start -->

The JTAG interface is an important tool for debugging and testing embedded
systems, providing low-level access to the internal workings of microcontrollers
and other integrated circuits. However, this powerful interface also presents
significant security threats. In the sixth and final part of this Diving into
JTAG article series, we will focus on security issues related to JTAG and the
Debug Port.

## Protection

Let's start by considering simple protection methods that can be applied to make
life more difficult for an attacker who wants to gain unauthorized access to a
device using the JTAG interface.

### Board-Level

The simplest, most obvious, but probably least effective method of protection is
to restrict access to the JTAG connector at the board level. This restriction is
achieved by physically removing the JTAG connector from the board at the end of
production, as shown in this picture, where you can see that the JTAG connector
was removed:

 <img width="80%" src="{% img_url jtag-part6/board-level-protection-1.png %}" alt="The Board-level protection example 1" />
</p>

Another protection option is suitable when there is no JTAG connector on the
board at all and the JTAG pins are scattered across the board as test points.
For example, in the next picture, you can see that the board contains JTAG pins
as separate pads.

<p align="center">
 <img width="80%" src="{% img_url jtag-part6/board-level-protection-2.png %}" alt="The Board-level protection example 2" />
</p>

However, as you well understand, these methods provide only the most basic
protection, as soldering a JTAG connector is not a significant effort, nor is
finding the necessary JTAG pins on the microcontroller, especially when its part
number is written on the package, as shown in the photo. But even if the
microcontroller is unknown, there are ways to scan the pins of the
microcontroller to discover the necessary JTAG pins (I will discuss these
methods in more detail later).

### Chip-Level

Debug interfaces are convenient during device development and debugging, but it
is good practice to disable them in the release version of the device/firmware.
There are configurable bits in the microcontroller's non-volatile memory to
disable certain debug interface functions. The flexibility of configuring
protection features depends on the specific core and microcontroller model.

For instance, access to flash memory can be disabled. Some microcontroller
models support completely disabling the debug interface. The exact configuration
of possible protection features can be found in the microcontroller's
documentation. An example is the
[Flash Readout Protection (RDP) technology in STM32 microcontrollers](https://www.st.com/resource/en/application_note/an5156-introduction-to-security-for-stm32-mcus-stmicroelectronics.pdf).
This technology allows for the protection of the contents of the
microcontroller's embedded flash memory from being read through the debug
interface.

<p align="center">
 <img width="100%" src="{% img_url jtag-part6/rdp-levels.png %}" alt="The RDP Levels" />
</p>

RDP has three levels of protection (0, 1, and 2):

- **Level 0** (default RDP level) The flash memory is fully open, and all memory
  operations are possible in all boot configurations (debug features, boot from
  RAM, boot from system memory bootloader, boot from flash memory). There is no
  protection in this configuration mode that is appropriate only for development
  and debug.
- **Level 1** Flash memory accesses (read, erase, program), or SRAM2 accesses
  via debug features (such as serial-wire or JTAG) are forbidden, even while
  booting from SRAM or system memory bootloader. In these cases, any read
  request to the protected region generates a bus error. However, when booting
  from flash memory, accesses to both flash memory and to SRAM2 (from user code)
  are allowed.
- **Level 2** All protections provided in Level 1 are active, and the MCU is
  fully protected. The RDP option byte and all other option bytes are frozen and
  can no longer be modified. The JTAG, SWV (single-wire viewer), ETM, and
  boundary scan are all disabled.

RDP can always be leveled up. Increasing the level is necessary in the following
cases:

- **Intellectual property protection**: Increasing the RDP level prevents
  reading the contents of the flash memory, which protects the firmware and
  other important data from being copied or analyzed by third parties.

- **Prevention of unauthorized firmware modification**: At higher protection
  levels (e.g., Level 2), it becomes impossible not only to read but also to
  write to flash memory without completely resetting the microcontroller. This
  helps prevent the introduction of malicious modifications to the software.

- **Debugging protection**: When the RDP level is raised, the microcontroller
  disables debugging interfaces (e.g., JTAG or SWD), preventing attackers from
  using them to debug and analyze the program's operation.

- **Compliance with safety standards**: In some applications (e.g., automotive
  or medical technology), compliance with certain safety standards is required,
  which necessitates hardware-level data protection.

A level regression is possible with the following consequences:

- Regression from RDP level 1 to RDP level 0 leads to a flash memory mass erase
  and the erase of SRAM2 and backup registers. You may need to perform a level
  regression to update software already in flash memory or when you need to
  repair a production device that has been returned.
- In RDP level 2, no regression is possible.

In consumer products, RDP should always be set to at least level 1. This setting
prevents basic attacks through the debug port or bootloader. RDP level 2 is
mandatory for implementing applications with a higher level of security.

The RDP technology for STM32 is an example; similar protection technologies
exist for other microcontrollers.

## Attack

Naturally, if there are defense mechanisms against the use of debugging
interfaces, there are also well-known vulnerabilities in these defense
mechanisms. Let's consider the main and most well-known of them.

In general, all attacks can be divided into the following types:

- Software attacks are carried out in particular by exploiting bugs, weaknesses
  in protocols or untrusted code fragments. Attacks on communication channels
  (interception or usurpation) fall into this category. Software attacks account
  for the vast majority of cases. Their cost can be very low. They can be
  widespread and repeatable with tremendous damage. It is not necessary to have
  physical access to the device. The attack can be performed remotely.
- Hardware attacks require physical access to the device. The most obvious one
  uses the debug port if it is not secured. In general, however, hardware
  attacks are complex and expensive. They are carried out with specialized
  materials and require electronics skills. There is a distinction between
  non-invasive attacks (carried out at the board or chip level without
  destroying the device) and invasive attacks (carried out at the device and
  silicon level with the destruction of the package).

Attacks on the JTAG interface belong to the hardware non-invasive attack type.

### Detecting JTAG pins

If there is absolutely no documentation for a given chip, the first thing an
attacker would do is detect the actual JTAG pins. Special tools leverage some
features of the JTAG protocol to automate the detection process. Let's dive into
them.

#### IDCODE Scan

Feature one: very often the `IR` register is connected to the `IDCODE` register,
which means that the intended pinout can be tested by a method called **IDCODE
Scan**. This method is simple because there is no need to scan `IR` and the
`IDCODE` register has a fixed length of 32 bits. The algorithm of the method is
as follows:

1. First we select the pins we want to scan and put these pins in correspondence
   with JTAG lines (`TMS`, `TCK`, etc.), by luck, as you want. But, if there are
   too many pins to be tested, you can potentially reduce their number by doing
   some work with measuring the electrical parameters (resistance, voltage) of
   the tested pins and using these measurements to draw conclusions about the
   pin belonging to one or another JTAG signal, at least to determine GND and
   VCC and not to include these pins in further scanning. This procedure is
   shown very well in this video [clip](https://youtu.be/_FSM_10JXsM?t=753).
2. Generate the sequence `0b0100` on the selected `TMS` pin to move to the
   `Shift-DR` state.
3. Hold `TMS` in logic zero and generate 32 clock pulses on the `TCK` pin.
4. Read the bits to be advanced on `TDO`.
5. If more than one zero or one is read from `TDO`, this is a pretty good
   indication that the electrical JTAG connection is working properly. You can
   try googling the read `IDCODE` and with some luck, you will be able to
   determine not only the JTAG pins, but also the type of microcontroller. If
   the `TDO` pin reads only ones or zeros, you have incorrectly assigned the
   pins in step 1, and you need to reassign the pins and repeat the whole
   procedure.

However, this method has a number of disadvantages:

- This method does not find the `TDI` pin.
- If the JTAG circuit contains more than one TAP, it may take more than 32
  iterations to find `IDCODE`, which means that if after e.g. 64 iterations you
  do not get a `TDO` pattern similar to `IDCODE` on the `TDO` pin, it does not
  mean that you have selected the wrong pins; it is possible that the JTAG
  circuit contains many TAPs.

#### BYPASS Scan

This method uses the `BYPASS` register to scan the JTAG circuit. The `BYPASS`
register allows you to skip a logic element in the circuit and directly transfer
data from input to output, minimizing latency.

1. The first step is the same as the first step in the `IDCODE` scan method.
2. Send the sequence `0b01100` on the selected `TMS` pin to move it to the
   `Shift-IR` state.
3. Send the `BYPASS` command. Since the size of the `IR` register is not known,
   you have to send a large number of ones (as many as 1024, for example).
4. Send the sequence `0b11000` to the selected `TMS` pin, thus moving to the
   `Shift-DR` state.
5. Using the `TDI` output - send some bit pattern that can be easily recognized.
6. Read the bits from the `TDO` pin. If a bit pattern is detected, it means that
   you have selected the pins correctly.

This algorithm is slower than the previous one, but it can detect all JTAG pins.

> If you have a lot of candidate output, it is recommended to first reduce the
> number of candidates using `IDCODE Scan` and then refine `BYPASS Scan`.

Of course, every time to do all these steps manually is quite boring and tedious
so smart people have long ago automated this process. Quite popular tools are:
[JTAGenum](https://github.com/cyphunk/JTAGenum/tree/master) and
[JTAGULATOR](http://www.grandideastudio.com/jtagulator/).

> If the highest level of RDP 2 protection has been applied to the
> microcontroller, JTAGulator and similar tools will not help.

Examples of such attacks are described in more detail in the following sources:

### Attack on JTAG

The next thing an attacker will determine is the number of devices in the JTAG
chain, because even if we have only one microcontroller connected to JTAG - the
number of TAPs in the chain may be more than one. Next, we need to determine the
lengths of the `IR` and `DR` registers, as well as the number of `DR` registers
theoretically available.

#### Determining the number of TAPs in a JTAG chain

The following algorithm can be used to determine the number of TAPs in a JTAG
chain:

- Send the sequence `0b01100` on the `TMS` pin, thus switching to the `Shift-IR`
  state.
- Push a bunch of ones (as many as you can spare, e.g., 1000) through `TDI` to
  all `IR` registers in the chain. After this, all TAPs will be in `BYPASS`.
- Send the sequence `0b11000` to the selected `TMS` pin, thus switching to the
  `Shift-DR` state.
- Push a bunch of zeros (as many as you can spare, e.g., 1000) through `TDI`
  into all `DR` pins in the chain to reset them to zero
- Start pushing ones through `TDI` into `DR`. As soon as you get a one from
  `TDO`, stop. The number of TAPs in the chain is equal to the number of ones
  pushed in.

#### Determining the size of `IR` and `DR`

The next step is to determine the length of the `IR` and `DR` registers:

- Send on the `TMS` pin the sequence `0b01100` thus moving to the `Shift-IR`
  state.
- Push many ones through `TDI` and then send 0.
- After that, keep pushing ones to `TDI`, counting the number of cycles before 0
  appears on `TDO`. The number of cycles (plus one) will equal the length of the
  `IR` register.
- To find the length of `DR`, perform the same steps, but in the `Shift-DR`
  state

#### Defining undocumented JTAG instructions

Defining undocumented instructions is useful to an attacker because in many
cases, these instructions hide test and debug functions, such as BIT modes for
memory and I/O; scan modes; or debug modes and functions.

In the last section, we determined the length of the `IR` register, and thus we
found out the theoretical number of available JTAG commands (`DR` registers).
However, the number of actually implemented commands can be much smaller than
the theoretical number. To determine the implemented commands, an attacker must
scan and check the whole range. Fortunately, the `IR` register is very often
relatively small and unrealized commands usually behave like `BYPASS` or
generate some fixed value on the `TDO` pin. However, even with these facts,
identifying undocumented commands is a very difficult task, because the
implementation of commands other than standard commands is not specified in JTAG
and each manufacturer is free to do what it wants, so there is no universal
algorithm, so it is almost always solved by searching all available commands and
trying to determine how the behavior of the microcontroller has changed to
understand what a particular command does.

### Debug Port (RDP) Attack

As we discussed when introducing RDP protection, any device released must have
protection enabled. In such cases, to copy the firmware, for example, an
attacker has to use techniques such as chip decapping or glitching the hardware
logic by manipulating inputs such as power or clock sources and using the
resulting behavior to successfully bypass these protections. However, sometimes
, an attacker does not have to use such hardcore methods to achieve their goal,
especially if the level of protection enabled is not the highest. In this
section, I will give a high-level description of a few attack techniques. For a
deeper dive, see the full articles linked with each.

#### Firmware dumping technique for an ARM Cortex-M0 SoC

The first example describes a technique that allows you to read firmware from
the nRF51822 device even though memory read protection is enabled. However, the
protection level leaves access to the Debug Port and allows the reading and
writing of processor registers and even executing debug commands such as step.
Through this exposure, an attacker can read the firmware.

Debugger access allows us to write values to the `PC` (program counter) register
to jump to any instruction and enables us to perform step-by-step execution of
instructions. We can also read and write the contents of the processor's
general-purpose registers. To read from protected memory, we need to find a
`load word` instruction with an operand register, set the target address in the
operand register, and execute this single instruction. Since we can't read flash
memory, we don't know where the instructions are located. Therefore, it may
sound difficult to find the read word instruction. However, all we need is an
instruction that reads memory from an address in some register to a register,
which is a fairly common operation.

This method is described in detail in the article
[Firmware dumping technique for an ARM Cortex-M0 SoC](https://blog.includesecurity.com/2015/11/firmware-dumping-technique-for-an-arm-cortex-m0-soc/).
I highly recommend reading it.

#### nRF52 Debug Resurrection (APPROTECT Bypass)

Here, the situation is more complicated, and the security level prohibits access
to Debug Port. Therefore, the previous method will not work.

This is where **voltage glitching** comes in. Voltage glitching (also known as
fault injection or power glitching) is a technique used in hacker attacks on
microcontrollers and other embedded systems to disrupt their normal operation
and gain access to protected information or functions. This technique is based
on temporarily changing (glitching) the power supply voltage of a device,
causing it to malfunction. While the microcontroller is running, short bursts
(glitches) of low or high voltage are applied at certain points in time that
disrupt the normal operation of the device. These glitches can cause errors in
the execution of processor instructions, such as skipping or incorrect execution
of individual instructions. This can cause the microcontroller to miss important
safety checks. If a glitch is successfully synchronized, it can disable security
mechanisms or access protected memory, allowing an attacker to retrieve
sensitive data or gain control of the system.

The main goal of this method is to find the exact time interval to apply this
glitch.

The author of
[nRF52 Debug Resurrection (APPROTECT Bypass) Part 1](https://limitedresults.com/2020/06/nrf52-debug-resurrection-approtect-bypass/)
leverages this method by determining the exact time when the AHB-AP has to
initialize itself according to the value of the APPROTECT, which is stored in
UICR (a dedicated Flash memory partition) and applies the glitch at that exact
time, which allows him to bypass the protection and gain access to the
DebugPort. I highly suggest reading the original article for a deeper dive on
this method.
