## ccache: The C Compiler Cache

We've written about the excellent `ccache` tool on Interrupt before:

["Improving Compilation Time of C/C++ Projects"]({% post_url
2020-02-11-improving-compilation-times-c-cpp-projects %})

`ccache` provides a wrapper around C/C++ compiler calls that _caches_ the output
object file, so that future calls with unmodified source files will just copy
the output file from the cache instead of wasting computation time recompiling
for the same result.

Getting the most out of `ccache` has a lot of overlap with Reproducible Builds,
which we've also covered on Interrupt:

[Reproducible Firmware Builds]({% post_url
2019-12-11-reproducible-firmware-builds %})

Using `ccache` can improve compilations times _dramatically_; often a 25x
speedup or faster, depending on the project. Keeping `ccache` working well can
also have a big impact on snappy CI builds, which improves developer quality of
life!

Let's dive right in.

## Diagnosing cache misses

The first step in dealing with `ccache` misses is identifying the cause of the
misses. There's three levels of debug techniques I use here:

### 1. Measure total cache misses

> Note: the example program and Makefile used in this article can be found in
> GitHub here:
> <https://github.com/memfault/interrupt/tree/master/example/ccache-debugging>

`ccache` keeps track of cache hits + misses, which can be viewed by running
`ccache -s` (or `ccache -sv` for more verbose output). When measuring cache
misses, first run `ccache -z` to zero out the stats, then run the build being
measured, then run `ccache -sv` to see the cache hit rate:

```bash
‚ùØ ccache -sv
Summary:
  Cache directory:    /home/noah/.cache/ccache
  Primary config:     /home/noah/.config/ccache/ccache.conf
  Secondary config:   /usr/local/etc/ccache.conf
  Stats updated:      Fri Sep 30 14:30:03 2022
  Hits:                  550 /  998 (55.11 %)
    Direct:              550 /  998 (55.11 %)
    Preprocessed:          0 /  448 (0.00 %)
  Misses:                448
    Direct:              448
    Preprocessed:        448
  Uncacheable:             2
Primary storage:
  Hits:                 1100 / 1996 (55.11 %)
  Misses:                896
  Cache size (GB):      4.64 / 5.00 (92.80 %)
  Files:              127188
  Cleanups:                1
Uncacheable:
  Called for linking:      2
```

In the above example, the hit rate is about 55%, which is pretty poor. It's nice
to have zero cache misses when possible! But often there's a few compilation
steps that use dynamic content and aren't practical to cache- in a large build,
having a few non-cached compilations is usually not too critical.

### 2. Identify objects that are missing the cache

The `ccache` manual does a good job of describing this process in the section
here:

<https://ccache.dev/manual/4.6.3.html#_cache_debugging>

The workflow I use is something like this:

```bash
# run the build command, outputting the ccache debug data into a folder named
# "ccache-debug-1":
‚ùØ CCACHE_DEBUG=1 CCACHE_DEBUGDIR=ccache-debug-1 make
# clean the build
‚ùØ make clean
# run the build command again, outputting ccache debug data into a different
# folder, "ccache-debug-2"
‚ùØ CCACHE_DEBUG=1 CCACHE_DEBUGDIR=ccache-debug-2 make
```

Now there's 2 sets of ccache debug data. Then I run this command to remove some
of the extra output to make it easier to debug (this is just one technique;
using a diff tool with filename filters would be another way):

```bash
# remove all but the *.ccache-input-text ccache debug files
‚ùØ find . \( -name '*.ccache-input-[cdp]' -o -name '*.ccache-log' \) -exec rm {} \;
```

Then I use a directory diff tool, of which there are a lot of options-
personally I use `meld`:

```bash
‚ùØ meld ccache-debug-1 ccache-debug-2
```

![]({% img_url ccache-debugging/meld-dirs.png %})

![]({% img_url ccache-debugging/meld-input-text.png %})

Using `diff`, the output looks like this:

```diff
‚ùØ diff -dur ccache-debug-1 ccache-debug-2
diff --color -dur ccache-debug-1/home/noah/dev/memfault/interrupt/example/ccache-debugging/main.o.ccache-input-text ccache-debug-2/home/noah/dev/memfault/interrupt/example/ccache-debugging/main.o.ccache-input-text

```

From this, we can see that there's a compiler argument, `-DBUILD_UUID`, that
changed from the first build to the second, and caused the cache miss.

We can also see there's a timestamp that changed from the first build to the
second.

### 3. Detailed examination of the ccache debug log

`ccache` in debug mode will spit out a detailed debug log. If the simple diff
technique above doesn't uncover the issue, digging through the log of a miss
should show the problem, though it's a bit more tedious.

To find `ccache` debug log files with cache misses, I use the following
`ripgrep` command:

```bash
‚ùØ rg --no-ignore 'Result: .*_miss'
ccache-debug-1/home/noah/dev/memfault/interrupt/example/ccache-debugging/main.o.ccache-log
65:[2022-09-30T14:58:02.545438 137617] Result: cache_miss
66:[2022-09-30T14:58:02.545440 137617] Result: direct_cache_miss
67:[2022-09-30T14:58:02.545441 137617] Result: preprocessed_cache_miss
68:[2022-09-30T14:58:02.545443 137617] Result: primary_storage_miss
```

Opening up that log file, we can see some interesting entries below:

Some notable log messages:

1. `Found __DATE__ in main.c` : this disables "direct" cache mode
2. `Include file generated_header.h too new` : this also disables "direct" mode

Dealing with those problems (see below for the strategies) and re-running
results in a successful cache hit üéâ, with this debug log entry:

## Common Problems

### Using `__TIME__` / `__DATE__`

It can be pretty handy to have the build timestamp inserted into the final
binary. The downside is this precludes fully reproducible builds üòï.

However, if it's desirable to use these macros in the program, try to isolate
them to a single compilation unit, for example:

```c
// build_time.h

const char *get_build_time(void);
const char *get_build_date(void);
```

```c
// build_time.c
#include "build_time.h"

const char *get_build_time(void) {
  return __TIME__;
}
const char *get_build_date(void) {
  return __DATE__;
}
```

Now instead of a cache miss everywhere that macro is used, there's just a single
miss when compiling `build_time.c` ü•≤

If it's undesirable to remove the `__TIME__` etc macros from a library or other
third party code being compiled, but the result is not important, an escape
hatch is to use one of the `ccache` Configuration Options to ignore the macros
when checking for a cache hit:

```bash
‚ùØ CCACHE_SLOPPINESS=time_macros
```

### Generated header files

If a generated header file is used very widely in a build, it can cause a lot of
`ccache` misses. Either rework the system to avoid propagating a generated
header, or take advantage of the `ccache` Configuration Option escape hatch
(note that this one is a little more risky):

```bash
‚ùØ CCACHE_SLOPPINESS=include_file_ctime,include_file_mtime
```

See
<https://ccache.dev/manual/4.6.3.html#_handling_of_newly_created_header_files>

### Build system injected command line options

In the example used in this article, the build system (Makefile) is passing a
random value when compiling `main.c`, which causes a cache miss on every build!

This problem is very situation-specific, but often requires some changes to the
project or build system infrastructure to deal with; in this case, the Makefile
was modified to permit overriding the offending variable when running:

```bash
# override the BUILD_UUID to be a fixed value, for reproducible builds
‚ùØ BUILD_UUID=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 make
```

Other build systems may permit similar control over dynamic values- it can be
tricky to track them down, so the `ccache` debug log is very helpful here!

### Compiler mtime changes

This problem is pretty niche, but can occur when the compiler itself is freshly
installed, but is the same exact compiler as was used when the cache was last
populated.

For example, if a build is running inside a Docker container, and the GCC
compiler is freshly installed on every build, `ccache` will consider the
compiler to be different.

There are various ways to deal with the problem; probably the most obvious is to
keep the compiler install static, for example by including it inside the Docker
image rather than installing on each build:

```bash
# check the mtime, modified time, for the gcc compiler inside the 'gcc:latest'
# Docker image
‚ùØ docker run --rm -i -t gcc bash -c 'stat $(which gcc)'
  File: /usr/local/bin/gcc
  Size: 1280424         Blocks: 2504       IO Block: 4096   regular file

 Birth: 2022-09-30 19:17:16.583945061 +0000
```

If that's not practical, luckily `ccache` has an option for dealing with this
scenario:

```bash
# have ccache use a hash of the compiler itself, instead of mtime of the
# compiler program
‚ùØ CCACHE_COMPILERCHECK=content
```
