title: WSL2 as a Firmware Development Environment
description: A comparison of WSL2 to traditional firmware development environments.

<!-- excerpt start -->

About a year and a half ago, in March of 2023, I took the leap: beginning a new
project for one of [Intercreate](https://www.intercreate.io/)'s clients, I
set up a Zephyr environment in WSL2 instead of my trusty VMWare Workstation
Linux VM.  Would hardware pass through for debugging work reliably?  Would all 
of the tooling dependencies be supported?  What about build system performance?

<!-- excerpt end -->

Not only did everything go smoothly, but since then, many colleagues
have also moved from native Linux or traditional VMs to WSL2 with great results.

This is a summary intended to guide you on the trade-offs that come with
the use of various development environments.  It is by no means exhaustive and I'd
welcome further feedback in the comments!  Some Zephyr benchmarks were devised
in order to quantify performance of some common Zephyr toolchains.

## Features and Limitations

The table below lists some of the common features that are assessed for a
firmware development host environment.  _Yes, you do need graphics to view that
schematic, no, there's not an emacs package for that._<sup>E</sup>  You'll see that a
few caveats are listed for each of the virtualized hosts.

### Graphics

If you've previously setup X forwarding in WSL2, you'll be happy to learn that this is no longer
necessary.  [Linux GUIs "Just Work" in WSL2!](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/gui-apps)

### Network

It‚Äôs no surprise that WSL2 can do anything you need over the network, since one of its
primary use cases is web development.  For example, you can establish remote
network connections, SSH in and out, and host web servers‚Äîincluding containers‚Äîthat will
be available to the Windows host‚Äîor even the LAN!

### USB

[usbipd-win](https://github.com/dorssel/usbipd-win) is
[officially recommended by Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/connect-usb)
and provides a stable foundation for USB forwarding including automatic attach
by both port and device.

### BLE

Even laptop BLE chips use USB, so you can easily forward an integrated or
dongled BLE device to WSL2.  However, the default WSL2 kernel does not include
`CONFIG_BT=y` and other modules that may be required for your specific chip. You
will need to compile your own WSL2 kernel (only takes about 10 minutes!) and see
the [discussion](https://github.com/dorssel/usbipd-win/discussions/310) over
at usbipd-win.  Please [let Microsoft know](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/242)
that this feature would be appreciated!

### Performance

There is a lot of confusion about WSL2 performance that's caused
by experiences with earlier versions of WSL or use of the Windows filesystem.  Regarding
the filesystem, it's important to understand that WSL2 creates a complete Linux
filesystem, from `/` up, and that you want to do your work there, probably under
`/home/<user/`, just like you would on Linux‚Äîbecause you are on Linux!  While it's nice
that you can use `bash` (or `zsh`, or whatever) and Linux apps from anywhere on your Windows
filesystem, there is a performance cost for doing so.

The performance differences between WSL2 and bare metal
Linux are [small](https://www.phoronix.com/review/windows11-wsl2-zen4/5),
[will continue shrinking](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Microsoft-WSL2-Linux-6.6-Kernel)
, and are not likely to meaningfully impact your workflow.

## Zephyr Benchmark

Recently, Intercreate upgraded my work laptop to the best I could find: a
[Framework 16](https://frame.work/products/laptop16-diy-amd-7040).  This laptop put me in a uniquely convenient position to run a
benchmark due to how easy it is to run both Windows and Linux.  Personally, I don‚Äôt enjoy
partitioning disks for dual booting.  While I appreciate improvements to
security like TPM, UEFI, Secure Boot, and Full Disk Encryption, they make the
dual booting process nerve-wracking enough that I am no longer willing do it on a
machine that I depend on at work.

Not only does the Framework have two (relatively accessible) M.2 drive slots,
it can be configured with
[SSD expansion cards](https://frame.work/products/storage-expansion-card-2nd-gen?v=FRACCFBZ0A-2)
that can boot an OS.  This means
that several of these cards with different operating systems can be plugged into the
laptop without the performance issues
associated with something like a Live USB, and without the headaches caused by
disk partitioning and GRUB.

So, I set out to quantify the performance trade-offs between developing Zephyr
on Native Ubuntu 24.04, WSL2 (Ubuntu 24.04), and Native Windows 11.

### The Test Fixture

#### Hardware: 
- Framework 16
  - CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 7840HS
    - Geekbench 6: 11,134
      - similar to an Intel Ultra 9 185H (12,110) or Apple M3 @ 4.1GHz
        8 CPU/10 GPU (11,704)
  - RAM: 32GB 5600 MHz DDR5 (2x CT16G56C46S5.M8G)
  - Windows (and WSL2) Storage: 2TB NVME (CT2000T500SSD8)
  - Ubuntu Storage: 250GB USB 3.2 Gen 2 (FRACCFBZ02-2)
- MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2023)
  - CPU: Apple M2 Pro @ 3.49GHz 12 CPU/19 GPU (14,195) 

> In order to compare macOS Zephyr performance to x86 platforms that cannot run
  macOS, the macOS results are scaled by the Geekbench 6 difference: 14,195 /
  11,134 = 1.245.  For example, if a task on the Ryzen 7840HS and the M2 Pro
  took the exact same amount of time, 100.0 seconds, the M2 Pro result would be
  scaled to 124.5 seconds to account for the hardware performance difference.

#### Zephyr Toolchain
- Zephyr @ 40810983ead23c954bce113cb7ace50592451da4 (3.7.0-rc2)
- Zephyr SDK 0.16.8
- cmake 3.28.3
- Python 3.12.4
- ninja 1.11.1

#### Benchmark

A benchmark shouldn't take too long, yet it should be long enough that it
smooths over some run-to-run issues you might see‚Äî_what are
Windows Defender and Windows Update up to during the run_ üîç?

In the Zephyr ecosystem, a tool called Twister[https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/test/twister.html]
is used to collect and run build-only, emulated, and on-target tests for Zephyr
boards and applications.

A build-only twister run representing four common platforms from
[ST](https://www.st.com),
[Nordic](https://www.nordicsemi.com),
[Espressif](https://www.espressif.com/),
and [NXP](https://www.nxp.com/),
was chosen in the hope that it overlaps with many developers' everyday Zephyr workflows.  The `drivers` test
folder was chosen because most projects would use some drivers and the build
times weren't too long.

```
./scripts/twister \
  -p esp32c3_devkitm \
  -p nrf52840dk/nrf52840 \
  -p mimxrt1060_evk \
  -p nucleo_g474re \
  -T tests/drivers
```

This command selects a total of 244 test builds between the
four platforms.  Some boards, like nrf52840dk, have more driver tests than the
other boards. 

244 Builds
- 55 nucleo_g474re (ST)
- 108 nrf52840dk (Nordic)
- 32 esp32c3_devkitm (Espressif)
- 49 mimxrt1060_evk (NXP)

Problems

- A new reason not to use Windows as your development environment!  While
  path length limitations have been mitigated by Microsoft, toolchains have not caught
  up.  I gave up trying to fix it and I'm not sure whether it's a CMake or Ninja
  problem.  Even after I used a workaround where I shortened the paths by assigning the
  root build path to a driver letter, still 48 of the 244 tests errored due to
  some object in the build exceeding the max path length.  This is an open
  [issue](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/issues/36358) at Zephyr.
- The native Ubuntu run is on a different disk than the Windows and WSL2 tests.
  While the Windows NVME drive is faster than the USB 3.2 Gen 2 drive, the test is
  expected to be primarily CPU bound instead of being bound by the 1,000MB/s read
  and 800MB/s write speeds of the SSD expansion card.
- Operating systems.  They do stuff.  It's hard to know why and when they do
  that stuff!  All tests were run with a single Chrome instance open on a
  default tab and the system set to "maximum performance".  Time permitting, the
  benchmark would be run many times.
- Test selection could be refined to cover a wider variety of build scenarios,
  targets, and toolchains.
- Couldn't get VMWare to use AMD-V.

### Native Ubuntu 24.04

```
Operating System: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS                  
          Kernel: Linux 6.8.0-36-generic
    Architecture: x86-64
```

All other platforms are compared to the Ubuntu results because Ubuntu is the
fastest.  For every platform, the duration of a Ubuntu 40 second long build is
compared.  40s was chosen as the nominal build time because it's a relatively long build
that I observed for a Zephyr project that used lots of libraries like LVGL,
nanopb, crypto, and BLE and many peripheral drivers like ADC, SPI, USB, and I2C.
This project's executable could be as big as 900kB.

### WSL2 Ubuntu 24.04

```
  Virtualization: wsl
Operating System: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
          Kernel: Linux 5.15.153.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2

I also compiled Kernel 6.1 and 6.6 for WSL2 and saw that Kernel 6.1 shrank the
performance gap by about 4%.  In my opinion, that's not worth it, but it shows
that WSL2's [upcoming upgrade](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL2-Linux-Kernel/releases)
to Kernel 6.6 may come with some more performance gains.

```
  Virtualization: wsl
Operating System: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS

```

### Windows 11

> Tip: One of the main things that slows down build systems in Windows is Windows Defender.  Build
systems do a ton of file IO and Windows Defender scans go wild during the build.  For
this test, I disabled Windows Defender entirely, which you should never do.  Instead,
you should painstakingly ignore your build folders and toolchains in
Defender settings and pray for better support from Microsoft someday!

> Note: Windows 11 wasn't able to properly complete the benchmark due
to issues with long paths generated by the build system.  I've compiled Zephyr
projects on Windows many times without (too many) problems, but this issue
does give me pause. Well, that, and it being half the speed of WSL2, at best!

| Metric                  | Result                                                      | Compared to Native Ubuntu |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Duration                | 23m 13.901s (includes a 274.201s penalty for errored tests) | + 12m 9.457s              |
| Average build duration  | 5.713s                                                      | + 2.990s                  |
| Workload multiplier     | 1,393.901 / 664.444                                         | * 2.098                   |
| Duration of a 40s build | 40.000 * 2.098 = 83.920s                                    | + 43.920s                 |

![Screenshot of the Windows benchmark run]({% img_url zephyr-development-environments/windows-twister-run-without-defender.png %})

### VMWare Workstation Pro 17 (no AMD-V)

```
  Virtualization: vmware
Operating System: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
          Kernel: Linux 6.8.0-39-generic
    Architecture: x86-64
```

| Metric                  | Result                   | Compared to Native Ubuntu |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Duration                | 27m 35.400s              | + 16m 30.956s             |
| Average build duration  | 6.785s                   | + 4.062s                  |
| Workload multiplier     | 1,655.56 / 664.444       | * 2.492                   |
| Duration of a 40s build | 40.000 * 2.492 = 99.680s | + 59.680s                 |

> Ouch.  Because I was unable to get VMWare to use AMD-V, this benchmark went extremely poorly
for VMWare.  Performance on par with WSL2 should be expected when VMWare is
configured correctly for AMD-V or Intel VT-x, but let this benchmark be a reminder
that you shouldn't take configuration and compatibility for granted!

## Developer Experience

This is a subjective 5-star rating of my personal **Firmware Developer Experience‚Ñ¢**
with the platforms discussed in this article.  I'd love to hear about other people's
experiences!

### Linux

‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

Pros:
- Control: choice of distro, desktop environment, kernel, and more.
- Zephyr performance: fastest of the platforms tested
- It‚Äôs free!
- üêß Cute penguin mascot!

Cons:
- Security:
  - Full disk encryption is not default in major desktop distros like
  Ubuntu and Fedora, leaving it up to IT departments or employees to enable
  and support.
  - Many companies and developers distribute software and scripts that are unsigned,
  leaving users open to attacks that impersonate their tools.  Install scripts may
  require sudo and users that have become used to running scripts like this may be
  unaware that they are willfully disabling Linux‚Äôs security model.  Heck, I‚Äôve
  even seen inline binary in unsigned bash scripts - a hacker‚Äôs dream!
- Hardware Support: Linux desktops tend to be much slower to receive driver
  support from manufacturers ‚Äî if they receive driver support at all.  Sometimes
  you have to wait for a community developed solution.
- Software Support: many tools in the Hardware and Electrical Engineering fields
  do not have Linux support.
- Your users
  [probably don't use Linux desktop](https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/worldwide).
  So, when you're developing tooling for them, you'll probably want to test on
  macOS or Windows.

In a bubble, booting Linux provides the perfect experience for development.
However, considering the wider ecosystems, I chose to dock one star for the
baggage that comes with Linux desktop: no agreed upon FDE, hardware and software
compatibility issues, security hubris, and minimal market share.

### WSL2

‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

Pros:
- You get most of the pros of a Linux environment and all of the pros of the
  Windows host.
- Resource allocation is automatic.  You can fiddle with CPU and RAM allocation,
  but you shouldn‚Äôt need to.  Storage is automatically resized as needed, so you
  never need to worry about running out of space for your WSL2 environment.
- Setup is very simple ‚Äî you can follow Intercreate‚Äôs tutorial below ‚Äî and
  supported by Microsoft.

Cons:
- Minimal choice of distros and fewer options for customizing your installation
  and kernel.  That‚Äôs not to say that you _can‚Äôt_, but rather that you will
  stray outside of the Microsoft support umbrella by doing so.
- BLE, and probably other kernel modules that I haven‚Äôt thought of, are not
  enabled in the default WSL2 configuration.
- Performance is not as good as running Linux on bare metal.

### Windows 11

‚≠ê‚≠ê

Oh, Windows.  WTF.  Microsoft has made a lot of progress towards making software
development a first-class experience, but there's still a lingering _je ne sais
quoi_ when using Windows.

Well, now we know one thing: it runs Zephyr builds at half the speed of
Linux!

Pros:
- Security: 
  - full disk encryption (BitLocker) is default and your recovery key is backed
    up to your Microsoft account
  - unsigned applications and scripts produce a warning (this is also a con)
- Hardware Support: if your product doesn't support Windows on release then it's
  dead on arrival.
- Software Support: mechanical and electrical engineering tools have long been
  built for Windows.
- Your users probably use it, so you'll need to support it anyway.

Cons:
- Zephyr performance: half the speed of Linux.
- Security:
  - Developer mode removes warnings about unsigned scripts and applications.
  - Microsoft requires yearly payment ‚Äî previously, to an approved certificate
  authority, now you have the option of paying MS directly ‚Äî in order to sign scripts
  and applications.  This has resulted in the widespread use of unsigned scripts
  and applications.  Even huge projects like Rye and WezTerm will trigger false
  positives for Trojans in Windows Defender and require the user to click through
  ‚Äúscary warnings‚Äù.  The global software ecosystem lives and dies by OSS and
  creating barriers to signing and authentication of OSS is dangerous for
  Microsoft‚Äôs customers and business.
- It‚Äôs $200, but you might never notice that when purchasing new laptops.
- It‚Äôs Windows.  This is more of a ‚Äúgut feeling‚Äù thing that I can best explain 
  with an anecdote.
  
  As I was setting up my new laptop, I used my Microsoft
  account when installing Windows, something that I had long avoided, not really
  for any specific reason.  It felt like I could potentially avoid ‚ÄúWindows problems‚Äù
  by being compliant here.  It went OK, except that it never prompted me for the
  name of my home (user) folder and then it named it incorrectly: ‚Äújphut‚Äù instead of
  ‚Äújp‚Äù.  Now, many people would have left it there.  And perhaps I should have. 
  But ‚Äújphut‚Äù is _wrong_.  Home is at `/home/jp`, or `c:/users/jp`, or `/users/jp` -
  this is how it has _always been_.  ‚ÄúNo big deal‚Äù, I thought. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll fix it!‚Äù 
  
  It took me 3 hours.  RegEdit.  Reviewing scripts left on Windows forums. 
  Seriously breaking my install.  Adding symlinks for OneDrive.  It‚Äôs been working
  fine for a few months now, but for all I know I‚Äôm out of spec in a weird way that
  will cause problems.  So, to quote Linus Torvalds, ‚ÄúF@&# you, \[Microsoft\]!‚Äù
- üìéUnsettling paperclip mascot!

### VMWare Workstation Pro

Pros:
- With a fully featured VM, you get most of the pros of Linux with access to 
  Window‚Äôs strong points when you need them.
- USB forwarding, including BLE, works well because you can run a full Linux
  distro of your choice with all the kernel modules that you need.
- SSH to a headless VM allows for a snappy, low-latency, experience in your
  terminal emulator and editor of choice.

Cons:
- Setup and maintenance.  VMs are complicated, and setting up and maintaining
  the VM takes time and research.  A common example is the allocation of disk 
  space.  Generally, you will need to allocate the space for your guest OS up
  front.  It can be hard to predict exactly how much space you really need, so
  you may end up needing to expand the virtual disk at some point, requiring
  steps to be taken from both the host and guest.

## Conclusion

Ultimately, choosing a development environment depends on what helps you to
be most productive.  Decisions about security, performance,
features, and stability must be weighed distinctly within each organization and
project.  Personally, I‚Äôve found a nice balance by using WSL2 on Windows 11. 
I get all of the security, stability, compatibility, and support of Windows while
being able to use my preferred tools in a Linux environment.  My primary concern,
performance, is eased by quantifying that a WSL2 Zephyr build system is only ~12% slower
than bare metal Linux.  If you compile big Zephyr projects with 40s build times - 
_pristine instead of incremental_ - 20 times a day (I don‚Äôt), WSL2 costs you an extra 1m 30s
of compile time.  For the tools that my work requires, that 1m 30s is an OK cost
to pay for all of the benefits that the Windows host provides.

If you‚Äôre interested in trying out WSL2 for firmware development, checkout the
[complete tutorial](https://github.com/intercreate/docs/blob/main/Windows/wsl2.md),
or stay tuned to the Interrupt where the tutorial will be published TBD.
