In this new era of work-from-home, firmware engineers may not have all the
equipment and development boards they are used to having at the office. One way
around this? Emulation!

While they're not quite the real thing, emulators can run our firmware, print
data over UART, read registers from I2C sensors, and even run a filesystem on a
SPI flash device. That's more than enough to write some real firmware!

<!-- excerpt start -->

In this post, I walk through setting up the Renode emulator and running a
firmware in it for STM32. Using that setup, we'll debug our firmware, run it
through integrated tests, and shorten the iteration cycle of development.

## What is Renode?

[Renode](https://renode.io/) is an open-source Emulator for embedded platforms.
Today, it supports x86 (Intel Quark), Cortex-A (NVIDIA Tegra), Cortex-M, SPARC
(Leon), and RISC-V based platforms.

Renode can take the same firmware you are running in production, and run it
against emulated cores, peripherals, and even sensors and actuators. Better
yet, its extensive networking support and multi-system emulation make it a shoe
in for testing systems made up of multiple devices talking together.

With Renode, you can start development before your hardware is ready, test your
firmware without deploying racks of hardware, and shorten your iteration cycles
by cutting out flash loading delays.

Renode is built using the Mono framework, which allows it to run cross-platform.

## Installing Renode

The Renode project releases installers for Windows, MacOS, and multiple Linux
distributions. As of this writing, you can find the v1.9 release on
[Github](https://github.com/renode/renode/releases/tag/v1.9.0).

This guide was written on MacOS, though it is not OS specific.

To verify your Renode installation, you can run one of the examples:

1. Open Renode, on MacOS I prefer to use the command line directly with `$ sh /Applications/Renode.app/Contents/MacOS/macos_run.command`
2. A Renode terminal window will open. Load the example with `start @scripts/single-node/stm32f4_discovery.resc`
   ![]({% img_url intro-to-renode/renode-first-demo-start.png %})
3. A second terminal window should open, displaying serial output
   ![]({% img_url intro-to-renode/renode-first-demo-output.png %})

## Running our firmware in Renode

Let's write a hello world firmware to run via Renode. We will target the STM23F4
Discovery board, as the emulator supports it out of the box.

### A simple firmware

I chose to use libopencm3[^1], an open-source library for ARM cortex-M
microcontrollers. I enjoy how easy it is to get started with it and appreciate
the consistent API across microcontrollers. Note however that the library is
still in its early stages and likely not fit for production use. I used the
libopencm3 template [^2] as a starting point.

To get to a "hello, world!", we must:

1. Setup the peripheral clocks
2. Enable the UART GPIOs
3. Configure the UART peripheral
4. Implement the `_write` syscall

I've reproduced the source code below, you can find the full project (Makefile
included) in the interrupt Github repo.

```c
#include <errno.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <libopencm3/stm32/rcc.h>
#include <libopencm3/stm32/gpio.h>
#include <libopencm3/stm32/usart.h>

static void clock_setup(void)
{
    /* Enable GPIOD clock for LED & USARTs. */
    rcc_periph_clock_enable(RCC_GPIOD);
    rcc_periph_clock_enable(RCC_GPIOA);

    /* Enable clocks for USART2. */
    rcc_periph_clock_enable(RCC_USART2);
}

static void usart_setup(void)
{
    /* Setup USART2 parameters. */
    usart_set_baudrate(USART2, 115200);
    usart_set_databits(USART2, 8);
    usart_set_stopbits(USART2, USART_STOPBITS_1);
    usart_set_mode(USART2, USART_MODE_TX);
    usart_set_parity(USART2, USART_PARITY_NONE);
    usart_set_flow_control(USART2, USART_FLOWCONTROL_NONE);

    /* Finally enable the USART. */
    usart_enable(USART2);
}

static void gpio_setup(void)
{
    /* Setup GPIO pin GPIO12 on GPIO port D for LED. */
    gpio_mode_setup(GPIOD, GPIO_MODE_OUTPUT, GPIO_PUPD_NONE, GPIO12);

    /* Setup GPIO pins for USART2 transmit. */
    gpio_mode_setup(GPIOA, GPIO_MODE_AF, GPIO_PUPD_NONE, GPIO2);

    /* Setup USART2 TX pin as alternate function. */
    gpio_set_af(GPIOA, GPIO_AF7, GPIO2);
}

int _write(int file, char *ptr, int len)
{
    int i;

    if (file == STDOUT_FILENO || file == STDERR_FILENO) {
        for (i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            if (ptr[i] == '\n') {
                usart_send_blocking(USART2, '\r');
            }
            usart_send_blocking(USART2, ptr[i]);
        }
        return i;
    }
    errno = EIO;
    return -1;
}

int main(void) {
    clock_setup();
    gpio_setup();
    usart_setup();

    printf("hello world!\n");

    while (1) {}

    return 0;
}
```

If all goes well, we now have a `renode-example.elf` file we can load in the
emulator.

### Running our firmware in Renode

Next up, we must spin up a machine in Renode and run our firmware in it.

Like we did earlier, we first start Renode:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/memfault/interrupt.git
$ cd example/renode/
$ make
# Note: on Linux this just is the "renode" command
$ sh /Applications/Renode.app/Contents/MacOS/macos_run.command
```

The window that pops up is called the Renode _monitor_. In it, you can run
Renode commands.

We now need to create a _machine_. A machine represents a device, which can have
a number of cores. Renode can run multiple machines in a single run.

We can create, add, and remove machines with the `mach` command:

```
(monitor) mach create
(machine-0)
```

The prompt now includes our machine name. Since we did not name our machine, it
just says "machine-0".

Next, we configure our machine. We could specify each bus and peripheral by
hand, but instead we will load a prebuilt configuration.

```
(machine-0) machine LoadPlatformDescription @platforms/boards/stm32f4_discovery-kit.repl
(machine-0)
```

You will notice that the path is prepended with the `@` sign. This is a C#-ism.
Renode will load absolute paths, as well as paths relative to your working
directory, and paths relative to the renode installation. In our case, we used
the latter as `platforms` is bundled with the Renode installation.

Next, we load our firmware:

```
(machine-0) sysbus LoadELF @renode-example.elf
(machine-0)
```

> Note: You can also load `.bin` files with `sysbus LoadBinary`

Before we start the machine, we want to do one last thing: open a terminal to
display UART data. Some peripherals come with what Renode calls "Analyzers",
which are ways to display their state and data. We enabled UART2 in our
firmware, so we will show the analyzer for UART2.

```
(machine-0) showAnalyzer sysbus.uart2
(machine-0)
```

You should now have two Renode windows open, the monitor window and the UART2
window.

We are now ready to run our simulation with the `start` command:

```
(machine-0) start
```

#### Adding CCM memory

... Well, this is embarrassing. Nothing happened.

In the terminal window we used to start the Renode app, we see line after line
of warnings:

```
[...]
20:46:07.5783 [WARNING] sysbus: [cpu: 0x8000926] WriteByte to non existing peripheral at 0x10152AA3, value 0x0.

20:46:07.5802 [WARNING] sysbus: [cpu: 0x8000926] WriteByte to non existing peripheral at 0x10152AAF, value 0x0.
[...]
```

Let's quit the emulator for now and restart it once things are fixed

```
(monitor) quit
```

Looking at our chip's memory map, we notice that `0x10XXXXXX` is in the CCM
region. Turns out the renode model does not implement it. Fear not! This is
easily fixed.

The easiest way to modify our Machine to add the CCM RAM is to write a Renode
Platform (or "repl") file. Repl files use YAML-like syntax to define
peripherals, including their type, address, and size.

You can read more about the Platform Description file format in the [Renode
Documentation](https://renode.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced/platform_description_format.html)
Adding our CCM region requires the following:

```
// In "add-ccm.repl"
ccm: Memory.MappedMemory @ sysbus 0x10000000
    size: 0x10000
```

Since platform descriptions are composable, We can now load that file using the
same `LoadPlatformDescription` command we used earlier:

```
(machine-0) machine LoadPlatformDescription @add-ccm.repl
(machine-0)
```

Putting it all together we have:

```
(monitor) mach create
(machine-0) machine LoadPlatformDescription @platforms/boards/stm32f4_discovery-kit.repl
(machine-0) sysbus LoadELF @renode-example.elf
(machine-0) machine LoadPlatformDescription @add-ccm.repl
(machine-0) showAnalyzer sysbus.uart2
(machine-0) start
```

And voila, we now have `hello world!` string in the analyzer!

![]({% img_url intro-to-renode/renode-hello-world.png %})

### Automating setup with a `.resc` script

Typing all this out is a bit of a hassle, this is where Renode Scripts ".resc"
files come in.

Not much documentation can be found on `.resc` files, but here are a few things
I was able to figure out:

1. variables can be created with `$` and assigned with `=`. For example: `$hello = "world"`.
2. renode are executed in the order written
3. macros can be defined with the keyword `macro`, and start and end with `"""`

Putting this all together, we can write the following script to setup our hello
world example:

```
# Filename: renode-config.resc
$bin?=@renode-example.elf

# Create Machine & Load config
mach create
machine LoadPlatformDescription @platforms/boards/stm32f4_discovery-kit.repl
machine LoadPlatformDescription @add-ccm.repl

# Create a terminal window showing the output of UART2
showAnalyzer sysbus.uart2

macro reset
"""
    sysbus LoadELF $bin
"""

runMacro $reset
```

We can start renode with this script by passing it as an argument to our renode
command. I wrapped it all in a `start.sh` shell script:

```
#!/bin/sh

sh /Applications/Renode.app/Contents/MacOS/macos_run.command renode-config.resc
```

> **Reset macro**: Renode looks for a macro named "reset", and uses it to reset
> the machine when the `machine Reset` or `machine RequestReset` are issued. In our script,
> we use that macro to reload our elf file every time, so we do not have to do
> it manually between resets. This also guarantees that the latest elf file is
> picked up and allows us to iterate on code quickly.

### Managing machine lifecycle

Starting renode every time you want to restart your machine is cumbersome.
Instead, we can use lifecycle commands to start, pause, and reset our machine:

```
# start a machine
(machine-0) start
# pause a machine
(machine-0) pause
# reset a machine
(machine-0) machine RequestReset
```

These are all pretty self-explanatory. Note that the `RequestReset` command will
invoke your `reset` macro if you have one specified.

Last but not least, you can drop the whole emulation by using the `Clear`
command.

## Debugging with Renode

Inevitably things will go wrong and you will need to debug them. This is one
area where Renode really shines.

### Tracing Function Calls

One of the advantages of emulators is that they make it much easier to
introspect and trace the device state. One of the more useful hooks exposed by
Renode is execution tracing. Provided you fed the emulator an ELF file with
debug symbols, Renode will print out log out every function being executed.

Going back to our hello world example, we can enable function tracing with a
single command:

```
(machine-0) sysbus.cpu LogFunctionNames True
(machine-0)
```

You will likely want to write the output to a file rather than stdout, you can
do this with a single command as well:

```
(machine-0) logFile @/tmp/function-trace.log
(machine-0)
```

Once we've started our emulation, we can retrieve the file and inspect it:

```
[...]

23:12:16 [INFO] cpu: Entering function usart_send_blocking (entry) at 0x80003B4¬

[...]
```

### GDB Integration

When it comes to debugging, GDB is my go to tool. I was pleasantly surprised to
learn that Renode will spin up a GDB server for you out of the box. This is
extremely easy to use.

First, we enable the GDB server and bind it to port 3333:

```
(machine-0) machine StartGdbServer 3333
(machine-0)
```

> Note: For the example config we have added this to renode-config.resc so it happens automatically
> when spinning up the environment

In a separate terminal window, we start GDB and connect to the server on port 3333.

```

We can then issue monitor commands to renode via the `monitor` gdb command, and

(gdb) n

(gdb)
```

## Renode & Integration Tests

Another area where emulation really shines is the ability to run automated tests
without hardware. Renode integrates with the Robot Framework[^3] to enable this
uses case.

A full tutorial on the Robot Framework is outside of the scope of this post, but
it is already quite useful.

To make the test more interesting, let's add a button to our firmware. The STM32
discovery board we are emulating has one on Port A pin 0, which we can enable
with a few lines of code:

```c
static void button_setup(void)
{
    /* Enable GPIOA clock. */
    rcc_periph_clock_enable(RCC_GPIOA);

    /* Set GPIOA0 to 'input floating'. */
    gpio_mode_setup(GPIOA, GPIO_MODE_INPUT, GPIO_PUPD_NONE, GPIO0);
}
```

We then modify our main function to test the state of the button

```c
    bool button_is_pressed = false;

    while (1) {
        if (!button_is_pressed && gpio_get(GPIOA, GPIO0)) {
            button_is_pressed = true;
        } else if (button_is_pressed && !gpio_get(GPIOA, GPIO0)) {
            printf("button pressed\n");
            button_is_pressed = false;
        }
    }
```

Not how we'd do it in production, but it works!

We can then write a simple Robot Framework script to exercise our firmware:

```robot
# Filename: test-button.robot
*** Settings ***
Suite Setup                   Setup
Suite Teardown                Teardown
Test Setup                    Reset Emulation
Resource                      ${RENODEKEYWORDS}

*** Test Cases ***
Should Handle Button Press
    Execute Command         mach create
    Execute Command         machine LoadPlatformDescription @platforms/boards/stm32f4_discovery-kit.repl
    Execute Command         machine LoadPlatformDescription @${PATH}/add-ccm.repl
    Execute Command         sysbus LoadELF @${PATH}/renode-example.elf

    Create Terminal Tester  sysbus.uart2

    Start Emulation

    Wait For Line On Uart   hello world
    Test If Uart Is Idle    3
    Execute Command         sysbus.gpioPortA.UserButton Press
    Test If Uart Is Idle    3
    Execute Command         sysbus.gpioPortA.UserButton Release
    Wait For Line On Uart   button pressed
```

This test will wait for the "hello world" string to print, then press and
release the button and wait for "button pressed" to print.

To run the test, we need to checkout and build the Renode codebase. You can find
step by step instructions on their website[^4]. We can then use the
`run_tests.py` script to execute our test.

```
python -u <path-to-renode>/tests/run_tests.py tests/test-button.robot -r test_results --variable PATH:$PWD
```

You'll notice a few things:

1. We passed a "test_results" folder to the script, which is a location that
   HTML test results will be written
2. We must pass the path to our working directory in a variable, as it is not
   propagated automatically

To make life easier, I wrapped this command in a shell script here as well:

```bash
#!/bin/sh

RC=${RENODE_CHECKOUT:-~/code/renode}

python -u $RC/tests/run_tests.py tests/test-button.robot -r test_results --variable PATH:$PWD
```

Running this shell script, we observe the test running!

```
$ ./test.sh

```

Success! As a bonus, the robot framework generates some pretty HTML reports:

## Closing

While we only scratched the surface of what Renode is capable of, I hope this
post helped you get up and running with firmware emulation.

In a future post, we will show how to model a custom device in Renode with
custom Platform Description files and some Python peripheral implementations.
