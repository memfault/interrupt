## Articles & Learning

* [Oxidize 1K YouTube Replay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPuELAzJyno&feature=youtu.be)  
  The entire set of talks from the online Oxidize Embedded Rust conference that took place on March 20th, 2020.
* [Security Analysis of the Solo Firmware](https://solokeys.com/blogs/news/security-analysis-of-the-solo-firmware-by-doyensec) by Emanuele Cesena.  
  A nice summary of a security audit of the firmware for an open source FIDO2 security keys by SoloKeys. The post explains a Downgrade Attack.
* [Making it easier to make Things: WebAssembly and the Internet of Things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oky3FdsTuUM) by Jonathan Beri.  
  An awesome 30-minute talk about running [Wasm3](https://github.com/wasm3/wasm3) on embedded devices such as an ESP32. It's well worth the watch.
* [Rewriting m4vgalib in Rust](https://cliffle.com/blog/m4vga-in-rust/) by Cliff Biffle  
  A fantastic journey through rewriting an embedded graphics demo in Rust from C++ by a well-known programmer. It answers all the important questions like how to not use a standard library, memory consumption, and impact on binary size.
* [Unleashing Mayhem over Bluetooth Low Energy](https://asset-group.github.io/disclosures/sweyntooth/)  
  A deep dive analysis into BLE vulnerabilities in popular BLE chipsets from Dialog, STMicro, and Cypress chips. 
* [GCC extensions to the C language](https://embeddedbits.org/gcc-extensions-to-the-c-language/) by Sergio Prado  
  A great overview of various GCC extensions for C. We'd also like to add one of our personal favorites to the list, GCC's [`__cleanup__` attribute](http://echorand.me/site/notes/articles/c_cleanup/cleanup_attribute_c.html) ([example in JerryScript](https://github.com/jerryscript-project/jerryscript/blob/b9f2b1cf25107b7eb6ff3e7a5a8cd18d8334a1dc/jerry-ext/include/jerryscript-ext/autorelease.impl.h#L22-L34))
* [Introduction to Trusted Execution Environment and ARM's TrustZone](https://embeddedbits.org/introduction-to-trusted-execution-environment-tee-arm-trustzone/) by Sergio Prado
* [How to Port a Board for RIOT](https://blog.martine-lenders.eu/riot-board-en.html) by Martine Lenders  
  RIOT being the [RIOT RTOS](https://riot-os.org/). I felt this was post-worthy because one can never read too much about driver abstraction in large projects.
* [PlatformIO x Renode Demo - Zephyr Build and Debug on SiFive FE310](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdC3kFZxSzI&feature=emb_logo)  
  This demo has every technical buzzword that people are excited about. PlatformIO, Renode, Zephyr, RISC-V, SiFive...
* [Exception(al) Failure - Breaking the STM32F1 Read-Out Protection](https://blog.zapb.de/stm32f1-exceptional-failure/) by Marc Schink & Johannes Obermaier.  
  A wonderfully technical and professional vulnerability write-up. Source-code is also available.
* [ARM GCC Inline Assembler Cookbook](http://www.ethernut.de/en/documents/arm-inline-asm.html)  
  Though this one isn't new, we stumbled upon it recently. Great reference on using inline assembly.
* [Hacking Your ELF For Fun And Profit](https://mgalgs.github.io/2013/05/10/hacking-your-ELF-for-fun-and-profit.html) by Mitch Humpherys  
  Fascinating post about how to use custom ELF sections to build a plug-in system, with a description about how this applies to the Linux Kernel.
* [Static analysis in GCC 10](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/03/26/static-analysis-in-gcc-10/) by David Malcolm  
  We **love** GCC and Clang, and we are always excited to see them have new features.
* [async/await on Embedded Rust](https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/async-on-embedded/) by Ferrous Systems  
  Using async/await on an ARM Cortex-M, complete with an [open-source example](https://github.com/ferrous-systems/async-on-embedded/). Definitely worth the read.
* [Mastering Embedded Linux Series](https://www.thirtythreeforty.net/posts/2020/03/mastering-embedded-linux-part-4-adding-features/) by George Hilliard

## Neat Open Source Projects

* [PetteriAimonen/Baselibc](https://github.com/PetteriAimonen/Baselibc) - A minimal libc for devices in the 10-100kB memory range. Can easily be included in [Apache MyNewt](https://mynewt.apache.org/latest/os/modules/baselibc.html) as well.
* [moon-chilled/Defer](https://github.com/moon-chilled/Defer) - A one line library which allows statements to run a function at return time, "generally to do cleanup". 
* [Google/Pigweed](https://pigweed.googlesource.com/pigweed/pigweed/) - A new project from an embedded team within Google.It sounds like much of this code is used across internal teams within Google, but it has been polished, packaged up, and open-sourced! We're excited to see where this goes.
* [ARMmbed/minimal-printf/](https://github.com/ARMmbed/minimal-printf/) - We had not seen this one yet! Readable `printf` implementation and with pretty low memory footprint!

## News

* [The SEGGER Compiler](https://blog.segger.com/the-segger-compiler/) - Yet another proprietary compiler. Sigh.
* [Introducing Amazon Common Software for Devices (Preview)](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/device-makers/2020/02/introducing-amazon-common-software-for-devices-preview)
* [An HP Enterprise SSD will brick after 40,000 hours](https://support.hpe.com/hpesc/public/docDisplay?docId=a00097382en_us)
