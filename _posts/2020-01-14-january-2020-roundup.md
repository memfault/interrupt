* [A Compiler Writing Journey](https://github.com/DoctorWkt/acwj) by Warren
  Toomey - An epic 62 part journey to write a self-hosting C compiler. 
* [Extracting secrets from an ArmV8-M Trustzone
  MCU](https://limitedresults.com/2020/01/nuvoton-m2351-mkrom-armv8-m-trustzone/)
by LimitedResults - A demonstration of fault injection techniques to alter and
extract secrets on a Nuvoton M2351 (Cortex-M23).

compared to its M4 and M7 cousins. Dmitry Grinberg develops a technique to get
as much fault information from those cores.
* [Glitch](http://cliffle.com/blog/introducing-glitch/) by Cliff L. Biffle - A
  walk through the internals of Glitch, a demo pushing graphics capabilities of
an STM32F4 to their very limits.
