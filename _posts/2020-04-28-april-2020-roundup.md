## Articles & Learning

* [Checking the Code of Zephyr Operating System](https://habr.com/en/company/pvs-studio/blog/495284/) by Andrey Karpov from PVS-Studio<br>
  The Zephyr RTOS source code is run through a professional static code analyzer, PVS-Studio, by its founder and he reports the findings.
* [Consider the Source - Microsoft RTOS White Paper (PDF)](https://azure.microsoft.com/mediahandler/files/resourcefiles/consider-the-source/Azure%20RTOS_Consider%20The%20Source_Whitepaper.pdf)<br>
  A white-paper from Microsoft shadow-pitching its newly acquired Azure RTOS (formerly ThreadX). Everything in here is obvious, but useful if you want to convince people to use an open-source RTOS instead of a proprietary one.
* [CppCon 2018: Matt Godbolt “The Bits Between the Bits: How We Get to main()” (Video 1h3m)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOfucXtyEsU) by Matt Godbolt<br>
  Great talk from CppCon 2018 given by the creator of [Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org/) detailing what happens before the `main()` function is called.
* [20 part linker essay](https://lwn.net/Articles/276782/) by Ian Lance Taylor<br>
  A compiled list of all the parts to the "20 part linker essay". Oldie but goodie and worth linking again (and many more times in the future).
* [MattPD/cpplinks - A categorized list of C++ resources](https://github.com/MattPD/cpplinks)<br>
  We found this repository which contains a gold-mine of C++ resources.
* [embedding binary objects in c](https://flak.tedunangst.com/post/embedding-binary-objects-in-c)<br>
  Succinct post on embedded blobs of data into a C program. This is a problem every embedded developer experiences, so bookmark this. A nice [discussion on HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22888318) as well.
* [Noisefloor: Writing One Firmware for 3 Cortex-M Chips](https://fromplantoprototype.com/r/noisefloor/) by Max Vilimpoc<br>
  From the author of the to-be-released book, "From Plan to Prototype" comes a nice walk-through on building designing, architecture, and building firmware for nRF5 devices.
* [Hardware Reversing to find UART and shell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmZuKA-Rst0) by Tony Gambacorta
<br>
  A post and complimentary video of reverse engineering a D-Link Camera.
* [Selecting the right hardware for embedded development of open-source protocol adapters](https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2020/04/selecting-hardware-embedded-development-open-source-protococol-adapters/) by Christofer Dutz<br>
  The step-by-step thought process on picking the hardware, process, software to build a low-level network gateway using Apache MyNewt 

## Neat Open Source Projects
* [rideskip/anchor - SONAR Protocol Spec & Implementation Added](https://github.com/rideskip/anchor/tree/master/sonar)<br>
  Another awesome open-source contribution by [Skip Scooters](https://rideskip.com/). "SONAR is point-to-point, client-server data communication protocol which allows two endpoints to reliably communicate over an arbitrary physical layer." I'd definitely keep an eye on this repo for more production quality contributions.
* [lief-project/LIEF - Library to Instrument Executable Formats](https://github.com/lief-project/LIEF)<br>
  Cross platform library to parse, modify and abstract ELF, PE and MachO formats.
* [Learn to write an embedded OS in Rust](https://github.com/rust-embedded/rust-raspberrypi-OS-tutorials/)<br>
  A thorough step-by-step lesson-plan for writing an embedded operating system in Rust for a Raspberry Pi.

## News

* [IntelliJ CLion for Embedded Improvements](https://blog.jetbrains.com/clion/2020/04/clion-2020-1-cuda-clang-embedded/)<br>
  My favorite embedded development environment gets even better, with support for PlatformIO, IAR, and custom remote targets. If you haven't tried out CLion recently, it's time to try again.
* [Apache NuttX](https://nuttx.apache.org/)<br>
  It appears that the NuttX RTOS is now Apache NuttX and is undergoing Incubation at The Apache Software Foundation.
* [New Azure RTOS Collaborations](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/new-azure-rtos-collaborations-with-leaders-in-the-semiconductor-industry/)<br>
  Azure RTOS seems to be shaping up, and I'm excited for the open sourcing of the project, given that Microsoft wrote an entire white-paper about how the only RTOS's that should be considered are ones that are open source.
