This is the third post in our [Zero to main() series]({% tag_url zero-to-main %}),
where we bootstrap a working firmware from zero code on a
cortex-M series microcontroller.

Previously, [we wrote a startup file to bootstrap our C environment]({% post_url
2019-05-14-zero-to-main-1 %}), and [a linker
script to get the right data at the right addresses]({% post_url
2019-06-25-how-to-write-linker-scripts-for-firmware %}). These two will allow us to
write a monolithic firmware which we can load and run on our microcontrollers.

In practice, this is not how most firmware is structured. Digging through vendor
SDKs, you’ll notice that they all recommend using a *bootloader* to load your
applications. A bootloader is a small program which is responsible for loading
and starting your application.

In this post, we will explain why you may want a
bootloader, how to implement one, and cover a few advanced techniques you may
use to make your bootloader more useful.

## Why you may need a bootloader

Bootloaders serve many purposes, ranging from security to software architecture.

Most commonly, you may need a bootloader to load your software. Some
microcontrollers like Dialog’s
[DA14580](https://www.dialog-semiconductor.com/products/connectivity/bluetooth-low-energy/smartbond-da14580-and-da14583)
have little to no onboard flash and instead rely on an external device to store
firmware code. In that case, it is the bootloader’s job to copy code from
non-executable storage, such as a SPI flash, to an area of memory that can be
executed from, such as RAM.

Bootloaders also allow you to decouple parts of the program that are mission
critical, or that have security implications, from application code which
changes regularly.  For example, your bootloader may contain firmware update
logic so your device can recover no matter how bad a bug ships in your
application firmware.

Last but certainly not least, bootloaders are an essential component of a
trusted boot architecture.  Your bootloader can, for example, verify a
cryptographic signature to make sure the application has not been replaced or
tampered with.

## A minimal bootloader
Let’s build a simple bootloader together. To start, our bootloader must do two
things:

1. Execute on MCU boot
2. Jump to our application code

We’ll need to decide on a memory map, write some bootloader code, and update our
application to make it bootload-able.

### Setting the stage

For this example, we’ll be using the same setup as we did in our previous Zero
to Main posts:
* Adafruit's [Metro M0 Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3505) as our
  development board,
* a simple [CMSIS-DAP Adapter](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2764)
* OpenOCD (the [Arduino fork](https://github.com/arduino/OpenOCD)) for
  programming

### Deciding on a memory map

We must first decide on how much space we want to dedicate to our bootloader.
Code space is precious - your application may come to need more of it - and you
will not be able to change this without updating your bootloader, so make
this as small as you possibly can.

Another important factor is your flash sector size: you want to make sure you
can erase app sectors without erasing bootloader data, or vice versa.
Consequently, your bootloader region must end on a flash sector boundary
(typically 4kB).

I decided to go with a 16kB region, leading to the following memory map:

```
        0x0 +---------------------+
            |                     |
            |     Bootloader      |
            |                     |
     0x4000 +---------------------+
            |                     |
            |                     |
            |     Application     |
            |                     |
            |                     |
    0x30000 +---------------------+
```

We can transcribe that memory into a linker script:

```
/* memory_map.ld */
MEMORY
{
  bootrom  (rx)  : ORIGIN = 0x00000000, LENGTH = 0x00004000
  approm   (rx)  : ORIGIN = 0x00004000, LENGTH = 0x0003C000
  ram      (rwx) : ORIGIN = 0x20000000, LENGTH = 0x00008000
}

__bootrom_start__ = ORIGIN(bootrom);
__bootrom_size__ = LENGTH(bootrom);
__approm_start__ = ORIGIN(approm);
__approm_size__ = LENGTH(approm);
```

Since linker scripts are composable, we will be able to `include` that memory
map into the linker scripts we write for our bootloader and our application.

You’ll notice that the linker script above declares some variables. We’ll need
those for our bootloader to know where to find the application. To make them
accessible in C code, we declare them in a header file:

```c
/* memory_map.h */
#pragma once

extern int __bootrom_start__;
extern int __bootrom_size__;
extern int __approm_start__;
extern int __approm_size__;
```

### Implementing the bootloader itself
Next up, let’s write some bootloader code. Our bootloader needs to start
executing on boot and then jump to our app.

We know how to do the first part from our previous post: we need a valid stack
pointer at address `0x0` , and a valid `Reset_Handler`  function setting up our
environment at address `0x4`. We can reuse our previous startup file and linker
script, with one change: we use  `memory_map.ld` rather than define our own
`MEMORY` section.

We also need to put our code in the `bootrom` region from our memory rather than
the `rom` region in our previous post.

Our linker script therefore looks like this:

```
/* bootloader.ld */
INCLUDE memory_map.ld

/* Section Definitions */
SECTIONS
{
    .text :
    {
        KEEP(*(.vectors .vectors.*))
        *(.text*)
        *(.rodata*)
        _etext = .;
    } > bootrom
  ...
}
```

To jump into our application, we need to know where the `Reset_Handler` of the
app is, and what stack pointer to load.  Again, we know from our previous post
that those should be the first two 32-bit words in our binary, so we just need
to dereference those addresses using the `__approm_start__` variable from our
memory map.

```c
/* bootloader.c */
#include <inttypes.h>
#include "memory_map.h"

int main(void) {
  uint32_t *app_code = (uint32_t *)__approm_start__;
  uint32_t app_sp = app_code[0];
  uint32_t app_start = app_code[1];
  /* TODO: Start app */
  /* Not Reached */
  while (1) {}
}
```

Next we must load that stack pointer and jump to the code. This will require a
bit of assembly code.

ARM MCUs use the [`msr` instruction
](http://www.keil.com/support/man/docs/armasm/armasm_dom1361289882044.htm) to
load immediate or register data into system registers, in this case the MSP
register or “Main Stack Pointer”.

Jumping to an address is done with a branch, in our case with a [`bx`
instruction](http://www.keil.com/support/man/docs/armasm/armasm_dom1361289866466.htm).

We wrap those two into a `start_app` function which accepts our `pc` and `sp` as
arguments, and get our minimal bootloader:

```c
/* bootloader.c */
#include <inttypes.h>
#include "memory_map.h"

static void start_app(uint32_t pc, uint32_t sp) __attribute__((naked)) {
    __asm("           \n\
          msr msp, r1 /* load r1 into MSP */\n\
          bx r0       /* branch to the address at r0 */\n\
    ");
}

int main(void) {
  uint32_t *app_code = (uint32_t *)__approm_start__;
  uint32_t app_sp = app_code[0];
  uint32_t app_start = app_code[1];
  start_app(app_start, app_sp);
  /* Not Reached */
  while (1) {}
}
```

> assumptions the app code is making about the state of the system

### Making our app bootloadable

We must update our app to take advantage of our new memory map. This is again
done by updating our linker script to include `memory_map.ld` and changing our
sections to go to the `approm` region rather than `rom`.

```
/* app.ld */
INCLUDE memory_map.ld

/* Section Definitions */
SECTIONS
{
    .text :
    {
        KEEP(*(.vectors .vectors.*))
        *(.text*)
        *(.rodata*)
        _etext = .;
    } > approm
  ...
}
```

We also need to update the [*vector
table*](https://developer.arm.com/docs/dui0552/latest/the-cortex-m3-processor/exception-model/vector-table)
used by the microcontroller. The vector table contains the address of every
exception and interrupt handler in our system. When an interrupt signal comes
in, the ARM core will call the address at the corresponding offset in the vector
table.

For example, the offset for the Hard fault handler is `0xc`, so when a hard
fault is hit, the ARM core will jump to the address contained in the table at
that offset.

By default, the vector table is at address `0x0`, which means that when our chip
powers up, only the bootloader can handle exceptions or interrupts! Fortunately, ARM
provides the [Vector Table Offset
Register](https://developer.arm.com/docs/dui0552/latest/cortex-m3-peripherals/system-control-block/vector-table-offset-register)
to dynamically change the address of the vector table. The register is at
address `0xE000ED08` and has a simple layout:

```
31                                  7              0
+-----------------------------------+--------------+
|                                   |              |
|              TBLOFF               |   Reserved   |
|                                   |              |
+-----------------------------------+--------------+
```

Where `TBLOFF` is the address of the vector table. In our case, that’s the start
of our text section, or `_stext`. To set it in our app, we add the following to
our `Reset_Handler`:

```c
/* startup_samd21.c */
/* Set the vector table base address */
uint32_t *vector_table = (uint32_t *) &_stext;
uint32_t *vtor = (uint32_t *)0xE000ED08;
*vtor = ((uint32_t) vector_table & 0xFFFFFFF8);
```

One quirk of the ARMv7-m architecture is the alignment requirement for the
vector table, as specified in section B1.5.3 of the [reference
manual](https://static.docs.arm.com/ddi0403/eb/DDI0403E_B_armv7m_arm.pdf):

> The Vector table must be naturally aligned to a power of two whose alignment value is greater than or equal
to (Number of Exceptions supported x 4), with a minimum alignment of 128 bytes.The entry at offset 0 is
used to initialize the value for SP_main, see The SP registers on page B1-8. All other entries must have bit
[0] set, as the bit is used to define the EPSR T-bit on exception entry (see Reset behavior on page B1-20 and
Exception entry behavior on page B1-21 for details).

Our SAMD21 MCU has 28 interrupts on top of the 16 system reserved exceptions,
for a total of 44 entries in the table. Multiply that by 4 and you get 176. The
next power of 2 is 256, so our vector table must be 256-byte aligned.

### Putting it all together

Because it is hard to witness the bootloader execute, we add a print line to
each of our programs:

```c
/* boootloader.c */
#include <inttypes.h>
#include "memory_map.h"

static void start_app(uint32_t pc, uint32_t sp) {
    __asm("           \n\
          msr msp, r1 /* load r1 into MSP */\n\
          bx r0       /* branch to the address at r0 */\n\
    ");
}

int main() {
  serial_init();
  printf("Bootloader!\n");
  serial_deinit();

  uint32_t *app_code = (uint32_t *)__approm_start__;
  uint32_t app_sp = app_code[0];
  uint32_t app_start = app_code[1];

  start_app(app_start, app_sp);

  // should never be reached
  while (1);
}
```

and:

```c
/* app.c */
int main() {
  serial_init();
  set_output(LED_0_PIN);

  printf("App!\n");
  while (true) {
    port_pin_toggle_output_level(LED_0_PIN);
    for (int i = 0; i < 100000; ++i) {}
  }
}
```

> Note that the bootloader *must* deinitialize the serial peripheral before
> starting the app, or you’ll have a hard time trying to initialize it again.

 You can compile both these programs and load the resulting elf files with `gdb`
which will put them at the correct address. However, the more convenient thing
to do is to build a single binary which contains both programs.

To do that, you must go through the following steps:
1. Pad the bootloader binary to the full 0x4000 bytes
2. Create the app binary
3. Concatenate the two

Creating a binary from an elf file is done with `objcopy` . To
accommodate our use case, `objcopy` has some handy options:

```
$ arm-none-eabi-objcopy --help | grep -C 2 pad
  -b --byte <num>                  Select byte <num> in every interleaved block
     --gap-fill <val>              Fill gaps between sections with <val>
     --pad-to <addr>               Pad the last section up to address <addr>
     --set-start <addr>            Set the start address to <addr>
    {--change-start|--adjust-start} <incr>
```

The `—pad-to` option will pad the binary up to an address, and `—gap-fill` will
allow you to specify the byte value to fill the gap with. Since we are writing
our firmware to flash memory, we should fill with `0xFF` which is the erase
value of flash, and pad to the max address of our bootloader.

We implement those rule in our Makefile, to avoid having to type them out each
time:

```
# Makefile
$(BUILD_DIR)/$(PROJECT)-app.bin: $(BUILD_DIR)/$(PROJECT)-app.elf
  $(OCPY) $< $@ -O binary
  $(SZ) $<

$(BUILD_DIR)/$(PROJECT)-boot.bin: $(BUILD_DIR)/$(PROJECT)-boot.elf
  $(OCPY) --pad-to=0x4000 --gap-fill=0xFF -O binary $< $@
  $(SZ) $<

```

Last but not least, we need to concatenate our two binaries. As funny as that
may sound, this is best achieved with `cat`:

```
# Makefile
$(BUILD_DIR)/$(PROJECT).bin: $(BUILD_DIR)/$(PROJECT)-boot.bin $(BUILD_DIR)/$(PROJECT)-app.bin
  cat $^ > $@
```

## Beyond the MVP

Our bootloader isn’t too useful so far, it only loads our application. We could
do just as well without it. In the following sections, I will go through a few
useful things you can do with a bootloader.

### Message passing to catch reboot loops

A common thing to do with a bootloader is monitor stability. This can be done
with a relatively simple setup:
1. On boot, the bootloader increments a persistent counter
2. After the app has been stable for a while (e.g. 1 minute), it resets the
   counter to 0
3. If the counter gets to 3, the bootloader does not start the app but instead
   signals an error.

This requires shared, persistent data between the application and the bootloader
which is retained across reboots. On some architectures, non volatile registers
are available which make this easy. This is the case on all STM32
microcontrollers which have RTC backup registers.

More often than not, we can use a region of RAM to get the same result. As long
as the system remains powered, the RAM will keep its state even if the device
reboots.

First, we carve some RAM for shared data in our memory map:

```
/* memory_map.ld */
MEMORY
{
  bootrom  (rx)  : ORIGIN = 0x00000000, LENGTH = 0x00004000
  approm   (rx)  : ORIGIN = 0x00004000, LENGTH = 0x0003C000
  shared   (rwx) : ORIGIN = 0x20000000, LENGTH = 0x1000
  ram      (rwx) : ORIGIN = 0x20001000, LENGTH = 0x00007000
}

/* shared data starts point at the origin of the shared region */
_shared_data_start = ORIGIN(shared);

```

We can then create a data structure and assign it to this section, with getters
to read it:

```c
/* shared.h */

#include <inttypes.h>

uint8_t shared_data_get_boot_count(void);

void shared_data_increment_boot_count(void);

void shared_data_reset_boot_count(void);

/* shared.c */

#include "shared.h"

extern uint32_t _shared_data_start;

#pragma pack (push)
struct shared_data {
  uint8_t boot_count;
};
#pragma pack (pop)

struct shared_data *sd = (struct shared_data *)&_shared_data_start;

uint8_t shared_data_get_boot_count(void) {
  return sd->boot_count;
}

void shared_data_increment_boot_count(void) {
  sd->boot_count++;
}

void shared_data_reset_boot_count(void) {
  sd->boot_count = 0;
}
```

We compile the `shared` module into both our app and our bootloader, and can
read the boot count in both programs.

### Relocating our app from flash to RAM

More commonly, bootloaders are used to relocate applications before they are
executed. Relocations involves copying the application code from one place to
another in order to execute it. This is useful when your application is stored
in non-executable memory like a SPI flash.

Consider the following memory map:

```
/* memory_map.ld */
MEMORY
{
  bootrom  (rx)  : ORIGIN = 0x00000000, LENGTH = 0x00010000
  approm   (rx)  : ORIGIN = 0x00010000, LENGTH = 0x00004000
  ram      (rwx) : ORIGIN = 0x20000000, LENGTH = 0x00004000
  eram     (rwx) : ORIGIN = 0x20004000, LENGTH = 0x00004000
}

__bootrom_start__ = ORIGIN(bootrom);
__bootrom_size__ = LENGTH(bootrom);
__approm_start__ = ORIGIN(approm);
__approm_size__ = LENGTH(approm);
__eram_start__ = ORIGIN(eram);
__eram_size__ = LENGTH(eram);
```

In this case, `approm` is our app storage and `eram` is our executable RAM,
where we want to copy our program. Our bootloader needs to copy the code from
`approm` to `eram` before executing it.

We know from our previous blog post that executable code typically ends up in
the `.text` section so we must tell the linker that this section is **stored** in
`approm` but executed from `eram` so our program can execute correctly.

This is similar to our `.data` section, which is stored in `rom` but lives in
`ram` while the program is running. We use the `AT` linker command to specify
the storage region and the `>` operator to specify the load region.  This is the
resulting linker script section:

```
/* app.ld */
SECTIONS {
    .text :
    {
        KEEP(*(.vectors .vectors.*))
        *(.text*)
        *(.rodata*)
    } > eram AT > approm
    ...
}
```

We then update our bootloader to copy our code from one to the other before
starting the app:

```c
  /* booloader.c */

  /* copy app code to eram */
  uint32_t *src = (uint32_t*) &__approm_start__;
  uint32_t *dst = (uint32_t*) &__eram_start__;
  int size = (int) &__approm_size__;
  printf("Copying firmware from %p to %p\n", src, dst);
  memcpy(dst, src, size);

  /* find app start & SP */
  uint32_t app_sp = dst[0];
  uint32_t app_start = dst[1];

  /* cleanup peripherals here we may have initialized */

  /* start the app */
  start_app(app_start, app_sp);
```


### Locking the bootloader with the MPU

Last but not least, we can protect the bootloader using the memory protection
unit to make it inaccessible from the app. This prevents accidentally erasing
the bootloader during execution.

If you do not know about the MPU, check out [Chris’s excellent blog post from a few
weeks ago]({% post_url 2019-07-16-fix-bugs-and-secure-firmware-with-the-mpu %}).

Remember that our MPU regions must be power-of-2 sized. Thankfully, our
bootloader already is! `0x4000` is 2^14 bytes.

We add the following MPU code to our bootloader:

```c
/* bootloader.c */
int main(void) {
  /* ... */
  base_addr = 0x0;
  *mpu_rbar = (base_addr | 1 << 4 | 1);
  //  AP=0b110 to make the region read-only regardless of privilege
  //  TEXSCB=0b000010 because the Code is in "Flash memory"
  //  SIZE=13 because we want to cover 16kiB
  //  ENABLE=1
  *mpu_rasr = (0b110 << 24) | (0b000010 << 16) | (13 << 1) | 0x1;

  start_app(app_start, app_sp);

  /* Not reached */
  while (1) {}
}
```

## Closing

We hope reading this post has given you a good idea of how bootloaders work, and
what you can do with them. As with previous posts, code examples are available
on Github in the [zero to main
repository](https://github.com/memfault/zero-to-main).

What cool things does your bootloader do? Tell us all about it in the comments,
or at [interrupt@memfault.com](mailto:interrupt@memfault.com).

Next time in the series, we'll talk about bootstrapping the C library!
