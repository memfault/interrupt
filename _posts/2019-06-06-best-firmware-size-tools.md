<!-- excerpt start -->

Every firmware engineer has run out of code space at some point or another.
Whether they are trying to cram in another feature, or to make enough space for
[A/B firmware
updates](https://sbabic.github.io/swupdate/overview.html#double-copy-with-fall-back)
more code space is always better.

In this [series of posts]({{ '/tag/fw-code-size' | relative_url }}) 
series of posts, we'll explore ways to save code space and ways not to
do it. We will cover compiler options, coding style, logging, as well as
desperate hacks when all you need is another 24 bytes.

But first, let's talk about measuring code size.

<!-- excerpt end -->

## Why measure?

Optimization is often counter intuitive. Don't take my word for it: this is one
of the topics [Microsoft's Raymond
Chen](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20041216-00/?p=36973) and [Unix
programmers](https://homepage.cs.uri.edu/~thenry/resources/unix_art/ch12s02.html)
agree on!

So before you do anything, measure where your code size is going. You may be
surprised!

## Measuring overall code size

The simplest way to measure code size is to inspect the different sections of
your elf file. The ARM GCC toolchain comes with a handy utility to do just that:
`arm-none-eabi-size`.

Let's try running it on one of our ELF files:

```terminal
$ arm-none-eabi-size build/with-libc.elf
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
  10800     104    8272   19176    4ae8 build/with-libc.elf
```

So in this program we have:
* 10800 bytes of `text`, which is code
* 104 bytes of `data`, which is statically initalized memory
* 8272 bytes of `bss`, which is zero-initialized memory

Unfortunately, the output of this tool is a little misleading. You may think
that your program will occupy `10800` bytes of flash, but this is not the case.

Indeed if we modify our linker script to specify that our flash size is 10800
exactly:

```diff
diff --git a/with-libc/samd21g18a_flash.ld b/with-libc/samd21g18a_flash.ld
index a07cc82b..f49e73e2 100644

   ram      (rwx) : ORIGIN = 0x20000000, LENGTH = 0x00008000
 }
```

We end up overflowing our flash!

```terminal
$ make
[...]
/usr/local/Cellar/arm-none-eabi-gcc/8-2018-q4-major/gcc/bin/../lib/gcc/arm-none-eabi/8.2.1/../../../../arm-none-eabi/bin/ld:
build/with-libc.elf section `.data' will not fit in region `rom'
/usr/local/Cellar/arm-none-eabi-gcc/8-2018-q4-major/gcc/bin/../lib/gcc/arm-none-eabi/8.2.1/../../../../arm-none-eabi/bin/ld:
region `rom' overflowed by 104 bytes
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
make: *** [build/with-libc.elf] Error 1
```

The 104 bytes overflow hints at the cause: we are overflowing our flash by
the size of our `data` section. This is because initialization values for our
initialized static variables are stored in flash as well.

To avoid confusion, I prefer to use a small script to compute the sizes:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

if [  $# -le 2 ]
then
    echo "This script requires 3 arguments."
    echo -e "\nUsage:\nget-fw-size FILE MAX_FLASH_SIZE MAX_RAM_SIZE \n"
    exit 1
fi

file=$1
max_flash=$2
max_ram=$3

function print_region() {
    size=$1
    max_size=$2
    name=$3

    if [[ $max_size == 0x* ]];
    then
        max_size=$(echo ${max_size:2})
        max_size=$(( 16#$max_size ))
    fi

    pct=$(( 100 * $size / $max_size ))
    echo "$name used: $size / $max_size ($pct%)"
}

raw=$(arm-none-eabi-size $file)

text=$(echo $raw | cut -d ' ' -f 7)
data=$(echo $raw | cut -d ' ' -f 8)
bss=$(echo $raw | cut -d ' ' -f 9)

flash=$(($text + $data))
ram=$(($data + $bss))

print_region $flash $max_flash "Flash"
print_region $ram $max_ram "RAM"
```

which gives us:
```terminal
$ ./get-fw-size build/with-libc.elf 0x40000
0x8000
Flash used: 10904 / 262144 (4%)
RAM used: 8376 / 32768 (25%)
```

Stick that in your Makefiles, and you'll have the size as you build
your firmware.

Note that an alternative to running `size` is to add the `-Wl,--print-memory-usage`
link-time flag which will give you something that looks like this:

```terminal
Memory region         Used Size  Region Size  %age Used
             rom:       10800 B       256 KB      4.12%
             ram:        8376 B        32 KB     25.56%
```

This falls into the same pitfall as `size` in that it does not count `data`
against ROM, and gives us less info since it does not break RAM out into `data`
and `bss`.

## Digging into functions

The above tells us *how much* code space we are using, but not *why*. To answer
the latter, we need to go deeper.

This is where another tool bundled with the GNU ARM toolchain comes in handy:
`arm-none-eabi-nm`.

`nm` allows us to print out all of the symbols in an ELF file, and with the
`--size` option it will also print the size of each symbol, and even sort them
by size if you specify `--size-sort`.

So if we want to dig into what symbols consume the most code space, we simply
do:

```terminal
$ arm-none-eabi-nm --print-size --size-sort --radix=d build/with-libc.elf | tail -30
00004420 00000100 T _write

00007544 00000620 T _vfprintf_r
00000430 00000692 t _usart_set_config
```

Note: you can also add `-l` to get filename & line # for each symbol.

Here we see that our largest symbol is `_usart_set_config` which uses 692
bytes of flash.

## Puncover

Although you can get quite far with the ARM GNU tools, my favorite tool for code
size analysis by far is [Puncover](https://github.com/memfault/puncover).
It was built by [Heiko Behrens](https://heikobehrens.net/), my former
coworker at Pebble.

Puncover will give you a full hierarchical view of both code size and static
memory per module, file, and function. See the screenshot below:

![](/img/code-size-1/puncover-1.png)

It also shows you details for each function, including callers, callees, and
disassembly.

![](/img/code-size-1/puncover-2.png)

Truly, it is a firmware analysis swiss army knife!

Using puncover is relatively straightforward. You'll need to lightly prepare
your codebase, setup the tool itself, and run it.

## Preparing our codebase

In order to for puncover to work, our elf file needs to contain the requisite
information. As such, you'll need to make sure you've got the following CFLAGS
set:

* `-g`: this generates debug information which puncover requires for analysis
* `-fdebug-prefix-map=/=`: this flag forces gcc to collect full paths for
  filenames. This allows puncover to create the hierarchical view of the code.
Even better would be to use your repository's root (usually found by running
`git rev-parse --show-toplevel`).

I typically add those two to my CFLAGS for every project directly in my
Makefile.

## Setting up puncover

Puncover is relatively straightforward to setup: you simply need to clone it,
setup a virtualenv, and install the dependencies.

```terminal
# Clone
$ git clone git@github.com:memfault/puncover.git

urllib3-1.24.3
```

## Running puncover

While you can install puncover as an executable, I typically just run the
`runner.py` script directly. All it requires is the path to your GNU ARM
toolchain:

```terminal
python runner.py --arm_tools_dir=<path-to-arm-tools-folder> --elf_file <path-to-elf-file>
```

Note that puncover needs the top level folder for your arm tools, not the `bin`
file. For me that's `/usr/local/Cellar/arm-none-eabi-gcc/8-2018-q4-major/`.

If all goes well, you should see that puncover has spun up a webserver:

```terminal
(venv) $ python runner.py
--arm_tools_dir=/usr/local/Cellar/arm-none-eabi-gcc/8-2018-q4-major/ --e_file
~/code/zero-to-main/with-libc/build/with-libc.elf
DEPRECATED: argument --arm_tools_dir will be removed, use --gcc_tools_base
instead.

Note: You may notice that some code size will be attributed to symbols under
`<Unknown>`. If you dig into those, you will see that they are all symbols
provided by the compiler or libc, such as `__aeabi_idiv0` or `_printf_i`. These
symbols do not come with file information as newlib is not compiled with `-g` in
most distributions. If you built your own newlib from source, you could fix
that!

## Epilogue

Upon reviewing this blog post, a friend suggested I look at Bloaty by Google.
You can check it out on [Github](https://github.com/google/bloaty) or just
download it from brew.

Bloaty is a nifty tool that wraps all the objdump analysis into a nice CLI
client, and can even tell you what sections, symbols, and files grew or shrunk
between two ELFs which would be very useful for a CI system.

What tools and technique do you use to debug code size? Let us know in the
comments!

Next in the series, we'll talk about compiler settings you can use to optimize
for code size.
