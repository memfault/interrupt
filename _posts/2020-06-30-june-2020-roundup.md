We hope you enjoy these links, and we look forward to hearing what you've been
reading in the comments.

## Articles & Learning

- [Embedded Systems Security and TrustZone](https://embeddedsecurity.io/) by
  Dimitrios Slamaris<br>Incredible resource published today on security best
  practices on an ARM Cortex-M, but starts from the basics with an intro into C
  programming, GNU tools, Cortex-M architecture, and bare-metal firmware
  tutorials. Really, really good. Bookmark this.
- [Fast Execute-Only Memory for Embedded Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00076)
  by Zhuojia Shen and John Criswell.<br>A paper about preventing remote code
  disclosure attacks with a clever use of the ARM Cortex-M MPU and DWT to
  implement Execute-Only-Memory (XOM).
- nRF52 Debug Resurrection (APPROTECT Bypass) -
  [Part 1](https://limitedresults.com/2020/06/nrf52-debug-resurrection-approtect-bypass/)
  &
  [Part 2](https://limitedresults.com/2020/06/nrf52-debug-resurrection-approtect-bypass-part-2/)
  by LimitedResults<br>A complete compromise of the flash readout protection on
  nRF52 series microcontrollers using simple voltage glitching techniques.
- [Using ASCII waveforms to test hardware designs](https://blog.janestreet.com/using-ascii-waveforms-to-test-hardware-designs/)
  by Andrew Ray<br>A seriously cool approach to using "snapshot" based testing
  to verify waveforms. This particular approach converts a hardware waveform
  from the device-under-test to an ASCII representation and then compares that
  to a previously recorded value.
- [Bare metal RISC-V programming in Go](https://embeddedgo.github.io/2020/05/31/bare_metal_programming_risc-v_in_go.html)
  by Michał Derkacz<br>Continuing on the quest for running Go on embedded
  devices, this post documents the effort of porting the project to the RISC-V
  architecture.
- [Using Callbacks with Interrupts](https://www.beningo.com/using-callbacks-with-interrupts)
  by Jacob Beningo<br>A simple post about how and why to implement drivers using
  callbacks and interrupts.
- [Making an Ultrasonic Anemometer](http://embedded-lab.com/blog/making-an-ultrasonic-anemometer/)
  by Raj Bhatt <br>Fascinating rabbit-hole in making a wind speed and direction
  sensor. The two projects linked
  ([one](https://www.dl1glh.de/ultrasonic-anemometer.html),
  [two](http://soldernerd.com/arduino-ultrasonic-anemometer/)) are both
  individual engineers documenting the process of building their own anemometer.

## Neat Open Source Projects

- [F´ (pronounced F-Prime)](https://nasa.github.io/fprime/) by NASA<br>A
  software framework from NASA to assist with the development of spaceflight
  devices.
- [Espressif RainMaker](https://rainmaker.espressif.com/) - The team at
  Espressif came out with an OTA solution for their devices using a mobile-based
  provisioning technique. We're excited to see more chip vendors provide
  value-added software alongside their silicon!
- [ayoy/FontEdit](https://github.com/ayoy/fontedit) - Simple font editor
  designed with embedded system displays in mind. Cross-platform GUI written in
  Qt.
- [Embench - A Modern Embedded Benchmark Suite](https://www.embench.org/) - An
  effort to come up with a standard benchmarking suite for embedded systems.
  Check out the [results here](https://github.com/embench/embench-iot-results).
- [eerimoq/Monolinux-Jiffy](https://github.com/eerimoq/monolinux-jiffy) - An
  embedded Linux based project which can boot in 0.37 seconds on an NXP i.MX6UL.
  Includes a design for a custom board as well. Another interesting bit is it
  uses a neat unit testing framework I had not seen called
  [nala](https://github.com/eerimoq/nala), which looks sleek.
- [Snek - A Python-inspired Language for Embedded Devices](https://sneklang.org/) -
  Language and complementary [board](https://sneklang.org/snekboard/) which runs
  a Python-like programming language specifically designed for embedded devices.
  It even has hooks for inclusion into NuttX!
- [Espirit ESP32-based Project](https://github.com/mfikes/esprit-board) - An
  open-source board design and software package which should be able to run
  ClojureScript on an ESP32 by using Emscripten.
- [QMK Firmware](https://qmk.fm/) - Open source firmware for keyboards that
  powers popular DIY keyboards such as the ErgoDox EZ and Clueboard.

## News

- [Ripple20 - 19 Zero-Day Vulnerabilities in IoT Devices](https://www.jsof-tech.com/ripple20/)
  by JSOF research lab <br>A collection of exploits targeting Treck's TCP/IP
  software stack, which potentially opens up 100+ million of connected devices
  to vulnerabilities.
- [Twilio Super SIM](https://www.twilio.com/docs/iot/supersim) - A service from
  Twilio in public beta that provides a global SIM card which can connect to a
  vast number of cellular providers. Pricing is $2 per month + $0.10 / MB.
- [Rust - async/await works with `#[no_std]` targets](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2020/06/04/Rust-1.44.0.html) -
  Embedded Rust projects can now use async/await with `#[no_std]` enabled, which
  should help with code space and code complexity.
