This is the second post in our "Zero to main()" series.

<!-- excerpt start -->
[Last time](https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/zero-to-main-1), we talked about
bootstrapping a C environment on an MCU before invoking our `main` function. One
thing we took for granted was the fact that functions and data end up in the
right place in our binary. Today, we're going to dig into how that happens by
learning about memory regions and linker scripts.
<!-- excerpt end -->

You may remember the following things happening auto-magically:
1. We used variables like `&_ebss`, `&_sdata`, ...etc. to know where each of our
   sections was placed in flash and to define where some needed to go in RAM.
2. A pointer to our `ResetHandler` was found at address 0x00000004 for the MCU
   to find.

While these things are true for many projects, they are held together at best by
convention, at worst by generations of copy/paste engineering. You'll find some
MCUs have different memory maps, some startup scripts name those variables
differently, and some programs have more or less segments.

Since they are not standardized, those things need to be specified somewhere in
our project. In the case of projects linked with a Unix-`ld`-like tool, that
somewhere is the linker script.

Once again, we will use our simple "minimal" program, available [on
Github](https://github.com/memfault/zero-to-main/blob/master/minimal).

### A brief primer on linking

Linking is the last stage in compiling a program. It takes a number of compiled
object files and merges them into a single program, filling in addresses so
that everything is in the right place.

Prior to linking, the compiler will have taken your source files one by one and compiled
them into machine code. In the process, it leaves placeholders for
addresses as (1) it does not know where the code will end up within the broader
structure of the program and (2) it knows nothing about symbols outside of the
current file or compilation unit.

The linker takes all of those object files and merges them together along with
external dependencies like the C Standard Library into your program. To figure
out which bits go where, the linker relies on a linker script - a blueprint for
your program. Lastly, all placeholders are replaced by addresses.

We can see this at play in our minimal program. Let's follow what happens to
our `main` function in `minimal.c` for example. The compiler builds it into
an object file with:

```
$ arm-none-eabi-gcc -c -o build/objs/a/b/c/minimal.o minimal.c <CFLAGS>
```

We can dump symbols in `minimal.o` to look at `main` within it:

```
$ arm-none-eabi-nm build/objs/a/b/c/minimal.o
...
00000000 T main
...
```

As expected, it does not have addresses yet. We then link everything with:
```
$ arm-none-eabi-gcc <LDFLAGS> build/objs/a/b/c/minimal.o <other object files> -o build/minimal.elf
```

And dump the symbols in the resulting `elf` file:

```
$ arm-none-eabi-nm build/minimal.elf
...
00000294 T main
...
```

The linker has done its job, and our `main` symbol has been assigned an address.

The linker often does a bit more than that. For example, it can generate debug
information, garbage collect unused sections of code, or run whole-program
optimization (also known as Link-Time Optimization, or LTO). For the sake of
this conversation, we will not cover these topics.

For more information on the linker, there's a great thread on [Stack
Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3322911/what-do-linkers-do).

### Anatomy of a linker script

A linker script contains four things:
* Memory layout: what memory is available where
* Section definitions: what part of a program should go where
* Options: commands to specify architecture, entry point, ...etc. if needed
* Symbols: variables to inject into the program at link time

### Memory Layout

In order to allocate program space, the linker needs to know how much memory is
available, and at what addresses that memory exists. This is what the `MEMORY`
section of the linker script is for.

The syntax for the memory section is defined in the [binutils
docs](https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/ld/MEMORY.html#MEMORY) and is as follow:

```
MEMORY
  {
    name [(attr)] : ORIGIN = origin, LENGTH = len
    â€¦
  }
```

Where
* `name` is a name you want to use for this section. Names do not carry meaning,
  so you're free to use anything you want. You'll often find "flash", and "ram"
as section names.
* `(attr)` are optional attributes for the region, like whether it's writable
   (`w`), readable (`r`), or executable (`x`). Flash memory is usually `(rx)`,
while ram is `rwx`. Marking a region as non-writable does not magically make it
write protected: these attributes are meant to describe the properties of the
memory, not set it.
* `origin` is the start address of the memory region.
* `len` is the size of the memory region, in bytes.

The memory map for the SAMD21G18 chip we've got on our board can be found in its
[datasheet](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/SAMD21-Family-DataSheet-DS40001882D.pdf)
in table 10-1, reproduced below.

<table align="center" border="0" summary="SAMD21G18 Memory map">
<caption>SAMD21G18 Memory Map</caption>
    <thead xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <tr><th>Memory</th><th>Start Address</th><th>Size</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <tr>
            <td>Internal Flash</td>
            <td>0x00000000</td>
            <td>256 Kbytes</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Internal SRAM</td>
            <td>0x20000000</td>
            <td>32 Kbytes</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<br/>

Transcribed into a `MEMORY` section, this gives us:

```
MEMORY
{
  rom      (rx)  : ORIGIN = 0x00000000, LENGTH = 0x00040000
  ram      (rwx) : ORIGIN = 0x20000000, LENGTH = 0x00008000
}
```

### Section Definitions

Code and data are bucketed into sections, which are contiguous areas of memory.
There are no hard rules about how many sections you should have, or what they
should be, but you typically want to put symbols in the same section if:
1. They should be in the same region of memory, or
2. They need to be initialized together.

In our previous post, we learned about two types of symbols that are initialized
in bulk:
1. Initialized static variables which must be copied from flash
2. Uninitialized static variables which must be zeroed.

Our linker script concerns itself with two more things:
1. Code and constant data, which can live in read-only memory (e.g. flash)
2. Reserved sections of RAM, like a stack or a heap

By convention, we name those sections as follow:
1. `.text` for code & constants
2. `.bss` for unintialized data
4. `.stack` for our stack
3. `.data` for initialized data

The [elf spec](http://refspecs.linuxbase.org/elf/elf.pdf) holds a full list.
Your firmware will work just fine if you call them anything else, but your
colleagues may be confused and some tools may fail in odd ways. The only
constraint is that you may not call your section `/DISCARD/`, which is a
reserved keyword.

First, let's look at what happens to our symbols if we do not define any of
those sections in the linker script.

```
MEMORY
{
  rom      (rx)  : ORIGIN = 0x00000000, LENGTH = 0x00040000
  ram      (rwx) : ORIGIN = 0x20000000, LENGTH = 0x00008000
}

SECTIONS
{
    /* empty! */
}
```

The linker is perfectly happy to link our program with this. Probing the
resulting elf file with objdump, we see the following:

```
$ arm-none-eabi-objdump -h build/minimal.elf
build/minimal.elf:     file format elf32-littlearm

SYMBOL TABLE:
no symbols
```

No symbols! While the linker is able to make asumptions that will allow it to
link in symbols with little information, but it at least needs to know either
what the entry point should be, or what symbols to put in the text section.

#### .text

Let's start by adding our `.text` section. We want that section in ROM. The
syntax is simple:

```
SECTIONS
{
    .text :
    {

    } > rom
}
```

This defines a section named `.text`, and adds it to the ROM. We now need to
tell the linker what to put in that section. This is accomplished by listing all
of the sections from our input object files we want in `.text`.

To find out what sections are in our object file, we can once again use
`objdump`:
```
$ arm-none-eabi-objdump -h
build/objs/a/b/c/minimal.o:     file format elf32-littlearm

Sections:
Idx Name          Size      VMA       LMA       File off  Algn

```

We see that each of our symbol has a section. This is due to the fact
that we compiled our firmware with the `-ffunction-sections` and `-fdata-sections` flags.
Had we not included them, the compiler would have been free to merge several
functions into a single `text.<some identifier>` section.

To put all of our functions in the `.text` section in our linker script, we use
the following syntax: `<filename>(<section>)`, where `filename` is the
name of the input files whose symbols we want to include, and `section` is the
name of the input sections. Since we want all `.text...` sections in all files,
we use the wildcard `*`:

```
.text :
{
    KEEP(*(.vector*))
    *(.text*)
} > rom
```

Note the `.vector` input section, which contains functions we want to keep at
the very start of our `.text` section. This is so the `Reset_Handler` is where the MCU
expects it to be. We'll talk more about the vector table in a future post.

Dumping our elf file, we now see all of our functions (but no data)!

```terminal
$ arm-none-eabi-objdump -t build/minimal.elf

build/minimal.elf:     file format elf32-littlearm

SYMBOL TABLE:
00000000 l    d  .text  00000000 .text

00000374 g     F .text  00000040 system_pinmux_pin_set_config
...
```

#### .bss

Now, let's take care of our `.bss`. Remember, this is the section we put
uninitialized static memory in. `.bss` must be reserved in the memory map, but there
is nothing to load, as all variables are initialized to zero. As such, this is
what it should look like:

```
SECTION {
    ...
    .bss (NOLOAD) :
    {
        *(.bss*)
        *(COMMON)
    } > ram
}
```

You'll note that the `.bss` section also includes `*(COMMON)`. This is a
special input section where the compiler puts global unitialized variables that
go beyond file scope. `int foo;` goes there, while `static int foo;` does not.
This allows the linker to merge multiple definitions into one symbol if they
have the same name.

We indicate that this section is not loaded with the `NOLOAD` property. This is
the only section property used in modern linker scripts.

#### .stack

We do the same thing for our `.stack` memory, since it is in RAM and not loaded.
As the stack contains no symbols, we must explicitly reserve space for it by
indicating its size. We also must align the stack on an 8-byte boundary per ARM
Procedure Call Standards
([AAPCS](https://static.docs.arm.com/ddi0403/ec/DDI0403E_c_armv7m_arm.pdf)).

In order to achieve these goals, we turn to a special variable `.`, also known
as the "location counter". The location counter tracks the current offset into a
given memory region. As sections are added, the location counter increments
accordingly. You can force alignemnt or gaps by setting the location counter
forward. You may not set it backwards, and the linker will throw an error if you
try.

We set the location counter with the `ALIGN` function, to align the section, and
use simple assignment and arithmetic to set the section size:

```
STACK_SIZE = 0x2000; /* 8 kB */

SECTION {
    ...
    .stack (NOLOAD) :
    {
        . = ALIGN(8);
        . = . + STACK_SIZE;
        . = ALIGN(8);
    } > ram
    ...
}
```

Only one more section to go!

#### .data

The `.data` section contains static variables which have an
initial value at boot. You will remember from our previous article that since RAM
isn't persisted while power is off, those sections need to be loaded from flash.
At boot, the `Reset_Handler` copies the data from flash to RAM before the `main`
function is called.

To make this possible, every section in our linker script has two addresses,
its *load* address (LMA) and its *virtual* address (VMA). In a firmware context,
the LMA is where your JTAG loader needs to place the section and the VMA is
where the section is found during execution.

You can think of the LMA as the address "at rest" and the VMA the address during
execution i.e. when the device is on and the program is running.

The syntax to specify the LMA and VMA is relatively straightforward: every address is
two part: <VMA> AT <LMA>. In our case it looks like this:

```
.data :
{
    *(.data*);
} > ram AT > rom  /* "> ram" is the VMA, "> rom" is the LMA */
```

Note that instead of appending a section to a memory region, you could also explicity
specify an address like so:

```
.data ORIGIN(ram) /* VMA */ : AT(ORIGIN(rom)) /* LMA */
{
    . = ALIGN(4);
    _sdata = .;
    *(.data*);
    . = ALIGN(4);
    _edata = .;
}
```

Where `ORIGIN(<region>)` is a simple way to specify the start of a region. You
can enter an address in hex as well.

And we're done! Here's our complete linker script with every section:

#### Complete Linker Script

```
MEMORY
{
  rom      (rx)  : ORIGIN = 0x00000000, LENGTH = 0x00040000
  ram      (rwx) : ORIGIN = 0x20000000, LENGTH = 0x00008000
}

STACK_SIZE = 0x2000;

/* Section Definitions */
SECTIONS
{
    .text :
    {
        KEEP(*(.vectors .vectors.*))
        *(.text*)
        *(.rodata*)
    } > rom

    /* .bss section which is used for uninitialized data */
    .bss (NOLOAD) :
    {
        *(.bss*)
        *(COMMON)
    } > ram

    .data :
    {
        *(.data*);
    } > ram AT >rom

    /* stack section */
    .stack (NOLOAD):
    {
        . = ALIGN(8);
        . = . + STACK_SIZE;
        . = ALIGN(8);
    } > ram

    _end = . ;
}
```

You can find the full details on linker script sections syntax in the
[ld
manual](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/4/html/Using_ld_the_GNU_Linker/sections.html#OUTPUT-SECTION-DESCRIPTION).

### Variables

In the first post, our `ResetHandler` relied on seemingly magic variables to know
the address of each of our sections of memory. It turns out, those variable came
from the linker script!

In order to make section addresses available to code, the linker is able
to generate symbols and add them to the program. 

You can find the syntax in the [linker
documentation](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/4/html/Using_ld_the_GNU_Linker/assignments.html),
it looks exactly like a C assignment: `symbol = expression;`

Here, we need:
1. `_etext` the end of the code in `.text` section in flash.
2. `_sdata` the start of the `.data` section in RAM
3. `_edata` the end of the `.data` section in RAM
4. `_sbss` the start of the `.bss` section in RAM
5. `_ebss` the end of the `.bss` section in RAM

They are all relatively straightforward: we can assign our symbols to the value
of the location counter (`.`) at the start and at the end of each section
definition.

The code is below:
```
    .text :
    {
        KEEP(*(.vectors .vectors.*))
        *(.text.*)
        *(.rodata.*)
        _etext = .;
    } > rom

    .bss (NOLOAD) :
    {
        _sbss = . ;
        *(.bss .bss.*)
        *(COMMON)
        _ebss = . ;
    } > ram

    .data :
    {
        _sdata = .;
        *(.data*);
        _edata = .;
    } > ram AT >rom
```

One quirk of these linker-provided symbols: you must use a reference to
them, never the variable themselves. For example, the following gets us a
pointer to the start of the `.data` section:

```c
uint8_t *data_byte = &_sdata;
```

You can read more details about this in the [binutils
docs](https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/ld/Source-Code-Reference.html).
