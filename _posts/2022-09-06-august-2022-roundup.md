## Articles & Learning

- [**Webinar: How to Build and Maintain IoT Management Systems for Scale - Memfault**](https://hubs.la/Q01kh_bT0)<br>
  Chris and I are summarizing a number of things hardware companies need to think about and address before they start trying to ship thousands of devices to end customers. Trust us, it can get hard quickly, and a company's success in shipping might make fighting fires and debugging that much more difficult. Tune in! - Tyler

- [**Virtual Panel: Debugging Embedded Devices in Production - Memfault**](https://hubs.la/Q01kj0GW0)<br>
  I had a blast talking to Phillip Johnston from Embedded Artistry and Alvaro Prieto from Sofar Ocean about how we debug hardware and firmware in production. Alvaro has some great stories!

- [**Debugging with GDB Introduction - Azeria Labs**](https://azeria-labs.com/debugging-with-gdb-introduction/)<br>
A nice tutorial on debugging with GDB on ARM and [gef](https://github.com/hugsy/gef). - Francois

Very interesting dev board with USB 3.0 and Gigabit Ethernet, based on a RISC-V SoC - Noah

- [**C99 doesn't need function bodies, or 'VLAs are Turing complete'**](https://lemon.rip/w/c99-vla-tricks/) by lemon<br>
An exercise stretching the C99 VLAs to the limits of their spec - Heiko.

Phillip Johnston joins Embedded.fm this time to talk about how engineer approaches change over time.

- [**Debugging bare-metal STM32 from the seventh level of hell - A Modicum of Fun**](https://jpieper.com/2022/08/05/debugging-bare-metal-stm32-from-the-seventh-level-of-hell/) by Josh Pieper<br>
Interesting journal of some severe heisen-debbugging session using techniques many programmers will hardly ever use. In the end, a reminder that programming against hardware is, well‚Ä¶ hard - Heiko.

- [**The case against a C alternative - Handmade Network**](https://c3.handmade.network/blog/p/8486-the_case_against_a_c_alternative) by Christoffer Lern√∂<br>
I like this piece as a discussion point ‚Äì all too often I see the hype around recent languages that claim to be the successor of C by looking only a singular aspect (memory handling, no surprises, etc). The author also reminded me of the ‚ÄúThe Killer Feature‚Äù effect that once made me buy a Ruby book üò± ‚Äì I have yet to see the equivalent for Rust et al.

A developer was trying to get Rust working on satellite-grade Vorago MCU's. It turns out there were no pre-existing libraries for such MCU's (duh) - Tyler.

- [**Using the i.MX RT600 Audio EVK as a Digital Audio Engineering Test Bed**](https://community.nxp.com/t5/Blogs/Using-the-i-MX-RT600-Audio-EVK-as-a-Digital-Audio-Engineering/ba-p/1514120)<br>
Write up about extending the RT685 EVK with a custom daughter card for use as an audio test system (one highlight: needing to bypass the level shifters for the application to work properly. level shifters are a classic point of failure!) - Noah

- [**Running GDB in the Browser**](https://blog.wokwi.com/running-gdb-in-the-browser/) by Uri Shaked<br>
Neat write-up about how wokwi got gdb to run in a web browser. - Noah

- [**Protobuffers Are Wrong :: Reasonably Polymorphic**](https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/blog/protos-are-wrong/) by Sandy Maguires<br>

## Announcements & News

- [**C23 is Finished: Here is What is on the Menu - The Pasture**](https://thephd.dev/c23-is-coming-here-is-what-is-on-the-menu) by JeanHeyd Meneide<br>
Some seriously cool improvements coming in C23 - Francois. Heiko is most excited for the first iterations of `auto` and `constexpr`.

- [**Introducing multitasking to Arduino - Arduino Blog**](https://blog.arduino.cc/2022/08/02/introducing-multitasking-to-arduino/) by Alessandro Ranellucci<br>
Arduino is getting multitasking! The blog post itself has very little information, but you can find the primary discussion [in a GitHub discussion](https://github.com/arduino/language/discussions/2).

- [**Nordic Semiconductor announces its first Wi-Fi chip, the dual-band Wi-Fi 6 nRF7002 - Nordic Semi**](https://www.nordicsemi.com/News/2022/08/Nordic-Semiconductor-announces-its-first-WiFi-chip)<br>
It's a "companion IC" so you don't write firmware for it, as it's meant to be used directly alongside one of Nordic's other devices to add Wi-Fi connectivity.
