One of the core features of the Memfault Linux SDK is the ability to capture and
analyze crashes. Since the inception of the SDK, we've been slowly expanding our
crash capture and analysis capabilities. Starting from the standard ELF
coredump, we've added support for capturing only the stack memory and even
capturing just the stack trace with no registers and locals present. This
article series will give you a high-level overview of that journey and a deeper
understanding of how coredumps work on Linux.

In this article, we'll start by taking a look at how a Linux coredump is
formatted, how you capture them, and how we use them at Memfault.

## What is a Linux Coredump

A Linux coredump represents a snapshot of the crashing process' memory. It can
be loaded into programs like GDB to inspect the state of the process at the time
of crash. It is written as an ELF[^elf_format] file. The entirety of the ELF
format is outside the scope of this article, but we will touch on a few of the
more important bits when looking at an ELF core file.

## What Triggers a Coredump

Coredumps are triggered by certain signals generated by or sent to a program.
The full list of signals can be found in the signal man page[^man_signal]. Here
are the signals that cause a coredump:

- `SIGABRT`: Abnormal termination of the program, such as a call to abort.
- `SIGBUS`: Bus error (bad memory access).
- `SIGFPE`: Floating-point exception.
- `SIGILL`: Illegal instruction.
- `SIGQUIT`: Quit from keyboard.
- `SIGSEGV`: Invalid memory reference.
- `SIGSYS`: Bad system call.
- `SIGTRAP`: Trace/breakpoint trap.

Of these, the most common culprits you'll likely see are `SIGSEGV`, `SIGBUS`,
and `SIGABRT`. These signals will be generated when a program tries to access
memory that it doesn't have access to, tries to dereference a null pointer, or
when the program calls `abort`. These typically indicate a fairly serious bug in
either your program or the libraries that it uses.

Coredumps are very useful in these situations, as generally, you're going to
want to inspect the running state of the process at the time of crash. From the
coredump, you can get a backtrace of the crashing thread, the values of the
registers at the time of crash, and the values of the local variables at each
frame of the backtrace.

## How are Coredumps Enabled/Collected

Enabling coredumps on your Linux device requires a few configuration options. To
start with, you'll need the following options enabled on your kernel at a
minimum:

```c
CONFIG_COREDUMP=y
CONFIG_CORE_DUMP_DEFAULT_ELF_HEADERS=y
```

These settings will enable the kernel to generate coredumps, as well as set the
default mappings that are present in the coredump. `man core`[^man_core]
provides a good overview of the options available to you when configuring
coredumps. It's worth noting that these options are enabled for most distros by
default.

In addition the kernel configuration, you'll need to set the `ulimit` for the
process that you want to capture a coredump for. The `ulimit` command is used to
set the resource limits for a process. The `core` resource limit is the one
we're interested in. This sets the maximum size of a coredump that can be
generated by a process. To make things easy, you can set it to unlimited with
the following command:

```bash
ulimit -c unlimited
```

### `core_pattern`

The kernel provides an interface for controlling where and how coredumps are
written. The `/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern`[^man_core] file provides two
methods for capturing coredumps from crashed processes. A coredump can be
written directly to a file by providing its path. For example, if we wanted to
write the core file to our `/tmp` directory with both the process name and the
pid, we would write the following to `/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern`.

```bash
/tmp/core.%e.%p
```

In this example, `%e` expands to the name of the crashing process, and `%p`
expands to the PID of the crashing process. More information on the available
expansions can be found in the `man core`[^man_core] page.

We can also pipe a coredump directly to a program, which is useful when we want
to modify the coredump in flight. The coredump is streamed to the provided
program via `stdin`. The configuration is similar to saving directly to a file ,
except the first character must be a `|`. This is how we capture coredumps in
the Memfault SDK, and will be covered more in-depth later in this article.

#### `procfs` Shallow Dive

An additional benefit to the `core_pattern` pipe interface is that until the
program that is being piped to exits, we have access to the `procfs` of the
crashing process. But what is `procfs`, and how does it help us with a coredump?

`procfs` gives us direct, usually read-only, access to some of the kernel's data
structures[^man_proc]. This can be system-wide information, or information about
individual processes. We are mostly interested in information about the process
that is currently crashing. We can get direct, read-only access to all mapped
memory by address through `/proc/<pid>/mem`[^man_proc_pid_mem], or look at the
command line arguments of the process through
`/proc/<pid>/cmdline`[^man_proc_pid_cmdline].

## Elf Core File Layout

Linux coredumps use a subset of the ELF format. The coredump itself is a
snapshot of the crashing process' memory, as well as some metadata to help
debuggers understand the state of the process at the time of the crash. We will
touch on the most important aspects of the core file in this article. We will
not be doing an exhaustive dive into the ELF format; however, if you are
interested in learning more about the ELF format, the ELF File
Format[^elf_format] is a great resource.

### ELF Header

The above image gives us a very high-level view of the layout of a coredump. To
start, the ELF header outlines the layout of the file and the source of the
file. We can see if the producing system was 32-bit or 64-bit, little or big
endian, and the architecture of the system. Additionally it shows the offset to
the program headers. Here is the layout of the ELF header[^elf_format]:

```c
typedef struct {
  unsigned char e_ident[EI_NIDENT];
  Elf32_Half e_type;
  Elf32_Half e_machine;
  Elf32_Word e_version;
  Elf32_Addr e_entry;
  Elf32_Off e_phoff;
  Elf32_Off e_shoff;
  Elf32_Word e_flags;
  Elf32_Half e_ehsize;
  Elf32_Half e_phentsize;
  Elf32_Half e_phnum;
  Elf32_Half e_shentsize;
  Elf32_Half e_shnum;
  Elf32_Half e_shstrndx;
} Elf32_Ehdr;
```

There is a lot going on here, but the fields that are most important to our
discussion are broken down below:

- `e_ident`: This field is an array of bytes that identify the file as an ELF
  file.
- `e_type`: This field tells us what type of file we are looking at. For our
  purposes, this will always be `ET_CORE`.
- `e_machine`: This field tells us the architecture of the system that produced
  the file. Common values here are
  [`EM_ARM`](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/c45323b7560ec87c37c729b703c86ee65f136d75/include/uapi/linux/elf-em.h#L26)
  for 32-bit ARM, and
  [`EM_AARCH64`](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/c45323b7560ec87c37c729b703c86ee65f136d75/include/uapi/linux/elf-em.h#L46)
  for aarch64.
- `e_phoff`: This field tells us the offset to the program headers.
- `e_phentsize`: This field tells us the size of each program header.

### Program Headers and Segments

The meat of our coredump exists in the program headers. A wide variety of
program header types are defined in the Elf File Format[^elf_format]. From the
perspective of the coredump, however, we are primarily interested in the
`PT_NOTE` and `PT_LOAD` program headers.

Program headers have the following layout[^elf_format]:

```c
typedef struct {
  Elf32_Word p_type;
  Elf32_Off p_offset;
  Elf32_Addr p_vaddr;
  Elf32_Addr p_paddr;
  Elf32_Word p_filesz;
  Elf32_Word p_memsz;
  Elf32_Word p_flags;
  Elf32_Word p_align;
} Elf32_Phdr;
```

Here is a brief breakdown of the fields we care about in the program header:

- `p_type`: This field tells us what type of segment we are looking at. This
  will be either `PT_NOTE` or `PT_LOAD` for our purposes.
- `p_offset`: This field tells us the offset from the beginning of the file
  where the segment starts.
- `p_vaddr`: This field tells us the virtual address where the segment is
  loaded.
- `p_paddr`: This field tells us the physical address where the segment is
  loaded.
- `p_filesz`: This field tells us the size of the segment in the file.
- `p_memsz`: This field tells us the size of the segment in memory.
- `p_align`: This field tells us the alignment of the segment.

We'll start by looking at the format of the `PT_NOTE` segments. Below is the
layout of a `PT_NOTE` segment.

![]({% img_url linux-coredump/elf-note-layout.png %})

The first two fields of the segment are fairly self-explanatory, they represent
the size of both the name and the descriptor. The `name` field is a string
representing the type of note. The `desc` field is a structure that contains the
actual data of the note. The `type` field tells us what type of note we are
looking at. It is an unsigned integer that represents the type of note. It's
worth noting that the `name` field works as a kind of namespace for the type
field. Two notes with the same type field can be differentiated by their name
field.

The `PT_LOAD` segment is a bit more straightforward. This represents a segment
of memory that was loaded into the process at the time of the crash. These can
represent either the stack, heap, or any other segment of memory that was loaded
into the process.

## Coredumps at Memfault: Rev. 1

Our first crack at coredumps at Memfault had one goal: leveraging existing tools
to capture info about a crashing process. To have feature parity with our
offering on MCU and Android, we needed a few basic things:

- A symbolicated backtrace for each running thread in the crashing process
- The values of registers at the time of crash
- Symbolicated local variables at each frame

Based on what we've learned about Linux core files so far, they are an obvious
fit for these requirements. We can use an established system to route
information about crashed processes, add metadata that helps give us information
about the device in question, and do all of this without making any source
modifications to anything running on the system. For this reason, our first pass
at coredumps leaves them largely untouched compared to what the kernel provides.
The only addition is a note that contains the metadata we use to identify
devices and the version of software they're running on. This takes advantage of
the fact that the `PT_NOTE` segment is a free-form segment that can be used to
add any metadata we want to the coredump.

This allows us to gather additional information about the process that crashed,
and more easily stream memory to avoid unnecessary allocations or memory usage.

Now that we've covered all the background information, we can dive into the
innards of the `memfault-core-handler`. First, we use the pipe operation that
was outlined earlier.
[Here](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-linux-sdk/blob/49adfe0ce0cb6082360012b0f0092a31e8030048/meta-memfault/recipes-memfault/memfaultd/files/memfaultd/src/coredump/mod.rs#L14)
is the pattern we write to `/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern` to pipe the coredump
to our handler:

```bash
|/usr/sbin/memfault-core-handler -c /path/to/config %P %e %I %s
```

This tells the kernel to pipe the coredump to our handler and provides the
handler with the PID of the crashing process (`%P`), the name of the crashing
process (`%e`), the UID of the crashing process (`%I`), and the signal that
caused the crash (`%s`).

When a crash occurs, the kernel will write the coredump to the `stdin` of the
handler. The handler will then read all the program headers into memory. This
sets us up to do two things. First, we'll read all of the `PT_NOTE` segments and
save them in memory. For the first iteration of the handler, we won't do
anything further with them until we write them to a file. They'll become more
important in later articles as we get into more of the special sauce of the
handler.

The next thing the handler does is read all of the memory ranges for each
`PT_LOAD` segment in the coredump. Instead of storing this in memory, we'll
stream it directly to the output file from `/proc/<pid>/mem`. We do this to
reduce the memory footprint of the handler and prevent any issues where we would
potentially need to seek backwards in the stream. As mentioned before, `stdin`
is a one way stream, and we can't seek backwards in it.

After we've written all of the `PT_LOAD` segments to the output file, we should
have an ELF coredump that is largely the same as what the kernel would have
written. The only difference is that we've added a note to the coredump, the
contents of which we won't cover in this article, as it's not particularly
interesting.

Let's take a quick visual look at everything we've accomplished by annotating
our previous ELF layout diagram with the changes we've made.

![]({% img_url linux-coredump/elf-core-layout-annotated.png %})

And there we have it! We've copied our coredump over from `stdin` with a few
minor changes. Now, you're probably wondering: why did we go through all of this
trouble to end up with a file that's largely the same as what the kernel would
have produced? Well, for one, it allows us to add metadata to the coredump, but
it also sets the stage for more advanced coredump handling in the future that
we'll cover in the next article.

## Conclusion

We've covered the basics of coredumps on Linux and how they're used in the
Memfault SDK. You should now have a pretty good idea of how things look under
the hood. While the baseline coredumps are useful and a known commodity, there
are a few things that aren't great about them. The biggest issue is that they
can be quite large for processes with many threads or do a large amount of
memory allocation. This can be a significant problem for embedded devices that
may not have a lot of room to store large files. In the next article, we'll take
a look at the steps we've taken to reduce the size of coredumps.

In the meantime, if you'd like to poke around the source code for the coredump
handler, you can find it
