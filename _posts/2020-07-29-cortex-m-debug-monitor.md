Debugging an MCU requires attaching a debugger via JTAG and halting the core. Or does it?

There are many situations where this debug strategy is not feasible such as on

- production units where JTAG has been disabled.
- systems where halting the core causes the subsystem you are trying to debug to
  fault. (i.e Asserts from the NRF52 SoftDevice after halting at a breakpoint[^6])
- remote systems where only a UART or network interface is exposed.

Fortunately, ARM Cortex-M's have us covered!

<!-- excerpt start -->

This week we explore how to debug running systems with ARM Cortex-M's DebugMonitor
exception handler. We cover how to configure the MCU to operate in this mode and walk through an
example of installing breakpoints and single-stepping on a running device!

<!-- excerpt end -->

> In my opinion, DebugMonitor handling is an underutilized feature that can be applied creatively
> for a variety of debug use cases. I hope by the end of this article I can convince you of this as well!

## Basic Terminology

ARM Cortex-M's support several "levels" of debug:

- **Halting debug** - This is the typical configuration you use with a debugger like GDB. In this mode, the core is
  halted while debugging. This mode requires access to the **Debug Port** via JTAG or SWD. We've
  walked through an overview of how ARM debug interfaces work in [this article]({% post_url
  2019-08-06-a-deep-dive-into-arm-cortex-m-debug-interfaces %}).
- Tracing via the **[ITM]({% post_url 2020-06-02-profiling-firmware-on-cortex-m %})**,
  **DWT** & **ETM** - These peripherals let you stream instruction execution and data
  accesses while the system is running. Tools such as Lauterbach's Trace32[^8] and SEGGER's JTrace[^9]
  can decode these streams and present results in a GUI on your desktop.
- **Debug monitor mode** - Enables debug on running systems via the DebugMonitor exception
  handler. This can be helpful in scenarios where halting the core will cause timing
  sensitive subsystems to fail or for use cases where connecting a debugger is not feasible.

> It's worth noting that debug monitor support is not available for the ARMv6-M architecture
> (Cortex-M0). However, it is implemented for all other Cortex-M architectures.

## Example Project Setup

In the following sections, we will explore how to set up Debug monitor mode with a very simple bare-metal application running on a nRF52 using the following tooling:

- a nRF52840-DK[^1] (ARM Cortex-M4F) as our development board
- SEGGER JLinkGDBServer[^2] as our GDBServer (V6.80b)
- GCC 9.3.1 / GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain as our compiler[^3]
- GNU Make as our build system
- the simple CLI shell [we built up in a previous post]({% post_url 2020-06-09-firmware-shell %}).
- PySerial's `miniterm.py`[^miniterm] to connect to the serial console on the nRF52.

In this article, we will extend upon the [example app we built to explore how breakpoints work]({% post_url 2020-06-17-cortex-m-breakpoints %}).

## Enabling the DebugMonitor Exception

Debug monitor mode based debugging works by triggering an exception known as the "DebugMonitor
Exception" when debug events take place. We'll explore how to configure the handler in the
following sections.

### Debug Halting Control and Status Register (DHCSR), 0xE000EDF0

![]({% img_url debugmon/dhcsr.png %})

Monitor Mode Debug only works if halting debug is disabled. Notably, the `C_DEBUGEN` setting
above must be cleared. This bit can _only_ be set via the JTAG/SWD connection and is _only_ reset when a full
Power-On-Reset (POR) occurs or a debugger clears the bit on exit.

If you are trying to use Monitor Mode Debug, I recommend adding a check on boot for
this. Otherwise, you are bound to confuse yourself when you are trying to test the feature and have a debugger connected via JTAG/SWD:

```c
bool debug_monitor_enable(void) {
  volatile uint32_t *dhcsr = (uint32_t*)0xE000EDF0;
  if ((*dhcsr & 0x1) != 0) {
    EXAMPLE_LOG("Halting Debug Enabled - "
                "Can't Enable Monitor Mode Debug!");
    return;
  }
  // code to set up debug monitor mode
}
```

#### TIP: Disabling Halting Debug from GDB

If you are using GDB, Halting Mode debug can be disabled manually by clearing `C_DEBUGEN` and setting
the appropriate value for `DBGKEY` (0xA05F):

```
(gdb) set *(uint32_t*)0xE000EDF0=(0xA05F<<16)
```

This can also be a useful way to keep an active GDB session open and probe its state while
the system is running!

### Debug Exception and Monitor Control Register (DEMCR), 0xE000EDFC

The core configuration for the DebugMonitor exception is controlled in the upper 16 bits of the
`DEMCR` register:

![]({% img_url debugmon/demcr.png %})

where:

- `MON_EN` - Controls whether the DebugMonitor exception is enabled or not. When enabled, debug
  "events" will cause the exception to fire.
- `MON_PEND` - Can be used to trigger a DebugMonitor exception irrespective of whether or not
  `MON_EN` is set to 1.
- `MON_REQ` - Not used by the MCU. Software can use this bit to convey state about monitor mode.
- `MON_STEP` - Can be toggled from the DebugMonitor exception to enable hardware
  single-stepping. When set, upon return from the exception handler, the core will execute a single instruction and then return to the DebugMonitor exception.

> NOTE: The lower bits (`VC_HARDERR`, etc) controls whether or not a debug trap occurs automatically when
> various types of exceptions take place. These _only_ take effect when using **halting debug**
> mode. They allow you to guarantee the system is halted any time an exception path is hit which can be useful
> when trying to debug!

#### DebugMonitor Exception Configuration Nuances

The DebugMonitor exception will only be triggered for debug events when the group priority of the
exception is greater than the current execution priority.

This can be a useful feature to guarantee that certain high priority operations (i.e Bluetooth
radio scheduling) continue to run while you step through the code in other parts of the system.

An important consequence however is it does mean any interrupts running above this priority of the
DebugMonitor exception will not be debuggable when using debug monitor support.

Configuring the DebugMonitor exception priority will require updating `SHPR3`. More details can be
found in [our post about ARM Cortex-M exception handling]({% post_url
2019-09-04-arm-cortex-m-exceptions-and-nvic
%}#system-handler-priority-register-shpr1-shpr3---0xe000ed18---0xe000ed20).

### C Code to Enable the DebugMonitor Exception

For simplicity in our example app we will set the DebugMonitor exception to the lowest configurable
interrupt priority. This means all other interrupts will be able to run while debugging code not
running from an interrupt.

Putting it all together, we have:

```c
bool debug_monitor_enable(void) {
  volatile uint32_t *dhcsr = (uint32_t*)0xE000EDF0;
  if ((*dhcsr & 0x1) != 0) {
    EXAMPLE_LOG("Halting Debug Enabled - "
                "Can't Enable Monitor Mode Debug!");
    return false;
  }

  volatile uint32_t *demcr = (uint32_t*)0xE000EDFC;
  const uint32_t mon_en_bit = 16;
  *demcr |= 1 << mon_en_bit;

  // Priority for DebugMonitor Exception is bits[7:0].
  // We will use the lowest priority so other ISRs can
  // fire while in the DebugMonitor Interrupt
  volatile uint32_t *shpr3 = (uint32_t *)0xE000ED20;
  *shpr3 = 0xff;

  EXAMPLE_LOG("Monitor Mode Debug Enabled!");
  return true;
}
```

## A minimal DebugMonitor Handler

We can use the same handler we put together in [our post about fault handling]({% post_url
2019-11-20-cortex-m-hardfault-debug %}#halting--determining-core-register-state) to dump register state
about the code which caused the DebugMonitor exception to be invoked:

```c
typedef struct __attribute__((packed)) ContextStateFrame {
  uint32_t r0;
  uint32_t r1;
  uint32_t r2;
  uint32_t r3;
  uint32_t r12;
  uint32_t lr;
  uint32_t return_address;
  uint32_t xpsr;
} sContextStateFrame;


void debug_monitor_handler_c(sContextStateFrame *frame) {
  // DebugMonitor Exception Logic
  // ...
}

__attribute__((naked))
void DebugMon_Handler(void) {
  __asm volatile(
      "tst lr, #4 \n"
      "ite eq \n"
      "mrseq r0, msp \n"
      "mrsne r0, psp \n"
      "b debug_monitor_handler_c \n");
}
```

### Debug Fault Status Register, DFSR, 0xE000ED30

When the DebugMonitor Exception fires, the DFSR can be inspected for information about what debug
event took place:

![]({% img_url debugmon/dfsr.png %})

Some of the events are only possible when using a **halting debug**. For the DebugMonitor the
states of interest are:

- `DWTTRAP` Indicates the a debug event was generated due to a configuration in the DWT.
- `BKPT` Indicates one or more breakpoint event took place (either via the FPB or a BKPT instruction).
- `HALTED` Indicates the core was halted due to a MON_STEP request.

> NOTE: DFSR bits are sticky and you have to write 1 to the value to clear them

#### Example C Code For DebugMon_Handler

Let's extend `debug_monitor_handler_c` to dump some of the state we are collecting:

```c
void debug_monitor_handler_c(sContextStateFrame *frame) {
  volatile uint32_t *demcr = (uint32_t *)0xE000EDFC;

  volatile uint32_t *dfsr = (uint32_t *)0xE000ED30;
  const uint32_t dfsr_dwt_evt_bitmask = (1 << 2);
  const uint32_t dfsr_bkpt_evt_bitmask = (1 << 1);
  const uint32_t dfsr_halt_evt_bitmask = (1 << 0);
  const bool is_dwt_dbg_evt = (*dfsr & dfsr_dwt_evt_bitmask);
  const bool is_bkpt_dbg_evt = (*dfsr & dfsr_bkpt_evt_bitmask);
  const bool is_halt_dbg_evt = (*dfsr & dfsr_halt_evt_bitmask);

  EXAMPLE_LOG("DebugMonitor Exception");

  EXAMPLE_LOG("DEMCR: 0x%08x", *demcr);
  EXAMPLE_LOG("DFSR:  0x%08x (bkpt=%d, halt=%d, dwt=%d)", *dfsr,
              (int)is_bkpt_dbg_evt, (int)is_halt_dbg_evt,
              (int)is_dwt_dbg_evt);

  EXAMPLE_LOG("Register Dump");
  EXAMPLE_LOG(" r0  =0x%08x", frame->r0);
  EXAMPLE_LOG(" r1  =0x%08x", frame->r1);
  EXAMPLE_LOG(" r2  =0x%08x", frame->r2);
  EXAMPLE_LOG(" r3  =0x%08x", frame->r3);
  EXAMPLE_LOG(" r12 =0x%08x", frame->r12);
  EXAMPLE_LOG(" lr  =0x%08x", frame->lr);
  EXAMPLE_LOG(" pc  =0x%08x", frame->return_address);
  EXAMPLE_LOG(" xpsr=0x%08x", frame->xpsr);

  // ...
}
```

#### Triggering a breakpoint

To test things out we can create a super simple CLI command that issues a breakpoint instruction:

```c
static int prv_issue_breakpoint(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  __asm("bkpt 1");
  return 0;
}
```

In one terminal you will need to start a gdbserver:

```bash
$ JLinkGDBServer  -if swd -device nRF52840_xxAA  -nogui
```

Then you need to compile the example application and flash it

```bash
$ cd ${INTERRUPT_REPO}/example/debugmon/
$ make
Compiling src/debug_monitor_exception.c
[...]
Linking library
Generated build/nrf52.elf
$ arm-none-eabi-gdb-py --eval-command="target remote localhost:2331"  --ex="mon reset" --ex="load"
--ex="mon reset"  --se=build/nrf52.elf
(gdb)
```

From GDB. we will disable halting debug so the program will continue running:

```
(gdb) set *(uint32_t*)0xE000EDF0=(0xA05F<<16)
```

In a final terminal we will open a serial connection using miniterm:

```bash
$ miniterm.py - 115200 --raw
--- Available ports:
...
---  4: /dev/cu.usbmodem0006838593731 'J-Link'
--- Enter port index or full name: 4
--- Miniterm on /dev/cu.usbmodem0006838593731  115200,8,N,1 ---
--- Quit: Ctrl+] | Menu: Ctrl+T | Help: Ctrl+T followed by Ctrl+H ---
shell> debug_mon_en
Monitor Mode Debug Enabled!
shell> bkpt
DebugMonitor Exception
DEMCR: 0x01010000
DFSR:  0x00000002 (bkpt=1, halt=0, dwt=0)
Register Dump
 r0  =0x00000001
 r1  =0x20003310
 r2  =0x73734900
 r3  =0x000009d5
 r12 =0xffffffff
 lr  =0x0000094b
 pc  =0x000009d4
 xpsr=0x210e0000
 ...
```

As expected we see bit 1 in `DFSR` is set indicating a breakpoint debug event was generated.
We can use GDB to inspect the instruction located at`0x000009d4` and confirm it is indeed a breakpoint
instruction:

```
(gdb) x/i 0x000009d4
  0x9d4 <prv_issue_breakpoint>:	bkpt	0x0001
```

We can also dump the instruction and confirm it matches the BKPT instruction encoding (`0xbe..`):

![]({% img_url breakpoint/bkpt-instruction-cortex-m.png %})

```
(gdb) p/x *(uint16_t*)0x000009d4
$4 = 0xbe01
```

### Programmatically installing Breakpoints with the FPB

In the FPB we can program one of the`FP_COMP` register to hold the address we would like to break
on.

The layout of the `FP_COMP` register is a little odd but basically for a given `instr_addr`, `FP_COMP[31:30]` map
`instr_addr[1:0]`, `FP_COMP[28:2]` map to `instr_addr[28:2]`, and the lowest bit `FP_COMP[0]` controls
whether the breakpoint is enabled or not.

For the NRF52, we can transcribe the logic into code as follows:

```c
bool fpb_set_breakpoint(size_t comp_id, uint32_t instr_addr) {
  if (instr_addr >= 0x20000000) {
    // for revision 1 only breakpoints in code can be installed :/
    return false;
  }
  // make sure the FPB is enabled
  FPB->FP_CTRL |= 0x3;

  const uint32_t replace = (instr_addr & 0x2) == 0 ? 1 : 2;
  const uint32_t fp_comp = (instr_addr & ~0x3) | 0x1 | (replace << 30);
  FPB->FP_COMP[comp_id] = fp_comp;
  return true;
}
```

> For more details on how to configure the Flash Patch And Breakpoint (**FPB**) unit,
> [check out our "How do breakpoints even work?" post]({% post_url 2020-06-17-cortex-m-breakpoints %}#flash-patch--breakpoint-unit)!

To facilitate breakpoint testing, I've added `dummy_function_1` through `dummy_function_9` to my
program. All the functions do is print the name of the function being executed:

```c
void dummy_function_3(void) {
  EXAMPLE_LOG("stub function '%s' called", __func__);
}
```

We will be calling these functions to test out our debug monitor mode implementation.

I've also added a few CLI commands to the shell to help us configure the DebugMonitor exception
handler, enable breakpoints, and call the dummy functions:

```bash
shell> help
bkpt: Issue a Breakpoint Instruction
debug_mon_en: Enable Monitor Debug Mode
fpb_dump: Dump Active FPB Settings
fpb_set_breakpoint: Set Breakpoint [Comp Id] [Address]
call_dummy_funcs: Invoke dummy functions
dump_dummy_funcs: Print first instruction of each dummy function
help: Lists all commands
```

Let's try configuring a breakpoint for `dummy_function_4`, address `0x270`, and see what happens:

```bash
shell> dump_dummy_funcs
 ...
dummy_function_4: Starts at 0x270. First Instruction = 0x48024901
 ...
shell> debug_mon_en
Monitor Mode Debug Enabled!

shell> fpb_set_breakpoint 0 0x270
Set breakpoint on address 0x270 in FP_COMP[0] Succeeded

shell> fpb_dump
FPB Revision: 0, Enabled: 1, Hardware Breakpoints: 6
  FP_COMP[0] Enabled 1, Replace: 1, Address 0x270
  ...

shell> call_dummy_funcs
stub function 'dummy_function_1' called
stub function 'dummy_function_2' called
stub function 'dummy_function_3' called
DebugMonitor Exception
DEMCR: 0x01010000
DFSR:  0x00000002 (bkpt=1, halt=0, dwt=0)
Register Dump
 r0  =0x200031d8
 r1  =0x00000028
 r2  =0x00000001
 r3  =0x00000271
 r12 =0xffffffff
 lr  =0x000009ed
 pc  =0x00000270
 xpsr=0x010f0000
```

As expected we see our `DebugMon_Handler` has been invoked on address `pc =0x00000270` which
is where we installed the breakpoint!

#### Adding a CLI to the DebugMonitor Exception

To add a CLI for DebugMonitor handling, all we need is a way to read in bytes over a UART from a ISR. This
can be done by either polling the peripheral or by using an interrupt that is configured to run at
a higher priority than the DebugMonitor exception to do the reading.

In our example app, we will add two commands:

- `c` - To continue after the DebugMonitor exception fires
- `s` - To step one instruction and then return to the DebugMonitor Exception

#### C Code Additions for DebugMonitor CLI

```c
typedef enum {
  kDebugState_None,
  kDebugState_SingleStep,
} eDebugState;

static eDebugState s_user_requested_debug_state = kDebugState_None;

void debug_monitor_handler_c(sContextStateFrame *frame) {
  // ... logic to dump info ...

  if (is_dwt_dbg_evt || is_bkpt_dbg_evt ||
      (s_user_requested_debug_state == kDebugState_SingleStep))  {
    EXAMPLE_LOG("Debug Event Detected, Awaiting 'c' or 's'");
    while (1) {
      char c;
      if (!shell_port_getchar(&c)) {
        continue;
      }

      EXAMPLE_LOG("Got char '%c'!\n", c);
      if (c == 'c') {
        s_user_requested_debug_state = kDebugState_None;
        break;
      } else if (c == 's') {
        s_user_requested_debug_state = kDebugState_SingleStep;
        break;
      }
    }
  } else {
    EXAMPLE_LOG("Resuming ...");
  }

  // ... other logic ...
}
```

### Debug Monitor Continue and Step Support

Stepping over a breakpoint is a several step process:

1. If it's a `bkpt` instruction, we need to advance the program counter by the size of the instruction (2
   bytes).
2. If a `bkpt` event was generated from a breakpoint configured in the FPB, we need to:
   - Disable the FPB. Otherwise, any attempt to continue will just hit the breakpoint again.
   - Single-Step one instruction.
   - Re-enable the FPB and disable single-stepping in order to resume program execution.

In our `DebugMon_Handler`, we can:

- inspect the `pc` from the `frame` parameter passed to `debug_monitor_handler_c` to figure out
  whether or not the debug event was caused by executing a breakpoint instruction.
- Disable/Enable the FPB by clearing & setting the `ENABLE` bit in the FPB `FP_CTRL` register.
- Enable/Disable single-step functionality by setting and clearing the `MON_STEP` bit in the `DEMCR`.

#### C Code Additions for DebugMonitor Breakpoint & Single-Step Handling

Let's implement the logic described above in code:

```c
  const uint32_t demcr_single_step_mask = (1 << 18);

  if (is_bkpt_dbg_evt) {
    const uint16_t instruction = *(uint16_t*)frame->return_address;
    if ((instruction & 0xff00) == 0xbe00) {
      // advance past breakpoint instruction
      frame->return_address += sizeof(instruction);
    } else {
      // It's a FPB generated breakpoint
      // We need to disable the FPB and single-step
      fpb_disable();
      EXAMPLE_LOG("Single-Stepping over FPB at 0x%x", frame->return_address);
    }

    // single-step to the next instruction
    // This will cause a DebugMonitor interrupt to fire
    // once we return from the exception and a single
    // instruction has been executed. The HALTED bit
    // will be set in the DFSR when this happens.
    *demcr |= (demcr_single_step_mask);
    // We have serviced the breakpoint event so clear mask
    *dfsr = dfsr_bkpt_evt_bitmask;
  } else if (is_halt_dbg_evt) {
    // re-enable FPB in case we got here via single-step
    // for a BKPT debug event
    fpb_enable();

    if (s_debug_state != kDebugState_SingleStep) {
      *demcr &= ~(demcr_single_step_mask);
    }

    // We have serviced the single step event so clear mask
    *dfsr = dfsr_halt_evt_bitmask;
  }
```

### Single Stepping On a Running System

Now we can test out the single-step feature for `dummy_function_4`.

We can use `disassemble` in GDB to determine what we expect to see if things are working.

```
(gdb) disass dummy_function_4
Dump of assembler code for function dummy_function_4:
   0x00000270 <+0>:	ldr	r1, [pc, #4]	; (0x278 <dummy_function_4+8>)
   0x00000272 <+2>:	ldr	r0, [pc, #8]	; (0x27c <dummy_function_4+12>)
   0x00000274 <+4>:	b.w	0x6c0 <example_log>
   0x00000278 <+8>:	strb	r6, [r2, #21]
   0x0000027a <+10>:	movs	r0, r0
   0x0000027c <+12>:	strb	r1, [r1, #20]
   0x0000027e <+14>:	movs	r0, r0
End of assembler dump.
```

We will install a breakpoint at address `0x270`, so if we single step after that we shold see, `0x272`,
`0x274` and then a branch to `0x6c0` executed by the processor.

```bash
shell> debug_mon_en
Monitor Mode Debug Enabled!

shell> fpb_set_breakpoint 0 0x270

shell> call_dummy_funcs

stub function 'dummy_function_2' called

stub function 'dummy_function_6' called

```

Nice, it works!

## Applications

There's a couple projects online today that make use of the debug monitor functionality. Notably,

- SEGGER ships an SDK[^4] that you compile into your project to enable Monitor Mode Debug support
  with SEGGER's tools. There's quite a few articles about how to make use of it on the NRF5x
  series[^5]. On the NRF52, this let's you set breakpoints in application code without triggering
  asserts in the Soft Device (because all that code runs from a higher priority interrupt).
- The Monitor For Remote Inspection Project on GitHub [^6] exposes a DebugMonitor port which
  implements the GDB Remote Serial Protocol[^7]. When compiled into a project, you can connect GDB
  directly to your board via the UART connection!

There's a lot of additional use cases you may want to include an
implementation for in your system as well. Some of my favorites include:

- exposing a debug interface for third party developers
  on an embedded platform.
- debugging of sealed units where there is only a UART or network interface exposed
- debugging power consumption issues where maintaining a SWD/JTAG connection would ruin attempts
  to monitor the quiescent current because the debug interface itself consumes a lot of power.

## Final Thoughts

I hope this article taught you a little bit about ARM debug monitor mode handling and got you thinking
about creative ways the feature can be leveraged.

Have you used the monitor mode debugging for any projects you've worked on. If so, we'd love to hear
what you used it for in the discussion area below!
