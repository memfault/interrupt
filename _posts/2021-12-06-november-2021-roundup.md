## Articles & Learning

- [How to monitor, debug & update your Embedded Android devices Webinar](https://go.memfault.com/how-to-monitor-debug-update-your-android-os-devices-webinar) by Ryan Case<br>
  Memfault put on a webinar last month covering all the tools and infrastructure you'll likely need to monitor, debug, and update embedded Android devices in the field. If you're working in the Android ecosystem, it's definitely worth the watch. 
- [5 Reasons Why I Dread Writing Embedded GUIs - Benjamin Cabé](https://blog.benjamin-cabe.com/2021/10/21/5-reasons-why-i-dread-writing-embedded-guis) by Benjamin Cabé<br>
  Writing GUI's in firmware is usually painful, and Benjamin agrees. I had to write a few user interfaces in the Pebble firmware during the 3.0 rewrite, and although it was fun and rewarding, it took way longer than it should have due to the lack of tooling as mentioned in the article. <br>
  Want your mind truly blown? Go watch [Heiko Behrens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC-ru1P3GVo) present his "demo" at Evoke 2017 on an OG Pebble.

  If you've been itching to run Ada on your devices, it sounds like now is a good time. They are working diligently on getting it to run on Cortex-M devices, as evidenced by this blog post and another one - [An Embedded USB Device stack in Ada](https://blog.adacore.com/an-embedded-usb-device-stack-in-ada)
- [Up and Running with ZephyrRTOS on Conexio Stratus IoT Kit - Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/piyareraj/up-and-running-with-zephyrrtos-on-conexio-stratus-iot-kit-4661a3)<br>
  A getting started post using Conexio and ZephyrRTOS. I don't have personal experience with Conexio, but they are working on integrating Memfault into their platform, which is a good sign in my book. 
- [A survey of concurrency bugs - Cove Mountain Software](https://covemountainsoftware.com/2021/03/01/a-survey-of-concurrency-bugs/) by Matthew Eshleman<br>
  A post on common embedded software concurrency bugs and their mitigations.
- [Real Time For the Masses goes multi-core - Embedded in Rust](https://blog.japaric.io/multicore-rtfm/) by Jorge Aparicio<br>
  RTFM, or Real Time For the Masses, which is a concurrency library for Rust tailed for embedded devices, has been updated to support Cortex-M multi-core chips. This post covers the new API and details how you can get started.

- [Reducing an LTO Linux kernel bug with cvise - Nathan Chancellor](https://nathanchance.dev/posts/cvise-lto-kernel-bug/) by Nathan Chancellor<br>
  Such a fun post. There's an art to reporting bugs, and that usually involves coming up with the absolute minimal reproducible issue that the maintainer can replay on their own machine. This is what Nathan did with a compiler bug related to LTO. During this post, I learned about [C-Reduce](https://embed.cs.utah.edu/creduce/).
- [A Close Look at a Spinlock – Embedded in Academia](https://blog.regehr.org/archives/2173) by John Regehr<br>
  A short and sweet post about spinlocks, a concurrency primitive.
- [I2C Communication Protocol: Understanding I2C Primer PMBus and SMBus - Analog Devices](https://www.analog.com/en/analog-dialogue/articles/i2c-communication-protocol-understanding-i2c-primer-pmbus-and-smbus.html)

## Conference Content

- [On Hubris and Humility: developing an OS for robustness in Rust :: Open Source Firmware Conference 2021 :: pretalx](https://talks.osfc.io/osfc2021/talk/JTWYEH/)<br>
  The team at [Oxide Computer](https://oxide.computer/) gave a talk on their new embedded RTOS written in Rust, Hubris, and debugging setup, Humility. This is all incredibly exciting and I can't wait to see how it progresses. 
- [2021 IoT Online Conference](https://www.iotonlineconference.com/)<br>
  The 2021 edition of the IoT Online Conference kicks off on December 8th. 
- [NoHat 21 - LimitedResults](https://limitedresults.com/2021/11/nohat-21/)<br>
  LimitedResults, known for exploiting the nRF52 and ESP32 series of chips, is at it again, this time with Silicon Labs EFM32 Gecko chips. He details the exploit which enables the reactivation of the ARM SWD debug port after being explicitly and "permanently" disabled by the Authentication Access Port, or AAP.  

## Tools & Projects

- [elfshaker/elfshaker: elfshaker stores binary objects efficiently](https://github.com/elfshaker/elfshaker)<br>
  An incredibly neat tool that takes many binary files and compresses them effeciently in a custom format. Since binary ELF files don't change often with rebuilds, and because normal compression like gzip doesn't work well on binaries, this tool can produce amazing results. They claim a 0.01% compression ratio when it's snapshotting many binaries at once! To prove their point, they also have [elfshaker/manyclangs](https://github.com/elfshaker/manyclangs), which is a GitHub repo of all LLVM builds ever, stored in 100MB. Impressive!
- [nadavrot/memset_benchmark](https://github.com/nadavrot/memset_benchmark)<br>
  `memcpy` and `memset` implements which outperform the folly and glibc versions. 
- [Dirbaio/rzcobs](https://github.com/dirbaio/rzcobs)<br>
  A spin on [rCOBS](https://github.com/Dirbaio/rcobs) that can compress data a bit further if it's known to have a lot of `0x00` bytes. 
- [silvergasp/bazel-embedded: Tools for embedded/bare-metal development using bazel](https://github.com/silvergasp/bazel-embedded)<br>
  A from-zero setup based on the [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) build system that is tailored for embedded systems and development. 
- [q3k/m16c-interface: A Serial IO programmer for Renesas M16C, includes security PIN bypass](https://github.com/q3k/m16c-interface)<br>
  A quick-and-dirty tool to load and dump the flash contents of a Renesas M16C.

## Random

- [Redis storage · ccache/ccache Wiki](https://github.com/ccache/ccache/wiki/Redis-storage)<br>
  At a previous employer, we always wanted to set up a distributed [ccache](https://ccache.dev/) cache. Unfortunately, it was always too complicated for us firmware engineers. I was surprised to find out that you can just use Redis (ideally hosted within a company VPC) and you can be off and running! Amazing.
