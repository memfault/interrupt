  enhanced privacy, including protection against fake cell towers.

## Events

- [**Tuesday, July 8 â€“ Coredump EP #012: Plugâ€‘andâ€‘Play Cellular Connectivity: Nearly Here or Never Happening?**](https://memfault.com/resources/plug-and-play-cellular-connectivity-nearly-here-or-never-happening/)<br>
  Vincent Korstanje (CEO, Kigen) joins us to unpack the fragmented reality of
  cellular IoT and where the industry is finally making progress. Standards like
  eSIM, iSIM, and new regulations are starting to streamline connectivityâ€”but
  many device makers are still stuck. Join us at 8am PT | 11am ET | 5pm CET.

- [**Tuesday, July 22 â€“ Coredump EP #013: Prepping Your AI Model for the Wild**](https://memfault.com/resources/building-edge-ai-models-for-the-real-world/)<br>
  Edge Impulseâ€™s David Tischler and Alessandro Grande join us to discuss why
  most ML models fail in production, and what to do about it. Weâ€™ll talk about
  noisy data, model drift, real-world variability, OTA updates, and what
  observability really means for AI at the edge. Catch it live at 8am PT | 11am
  ET | 5pm CET.

- [**Tuesday, August 24 â€“ _RESCHEDULED_ Coredump EP #015: Developing Kid-Safe Tech at Gabb: What It Takes and Why Itâ€™s So Important**](https://memfault.com/resources/developing-kid-safe-tech-at-gabb-what-it-takes-and-why-its-so-important/)<br>
  When you're building tech for kids, reliability isnâ€™t negotiable. Devices need
  to be always-on, always-connected, and dead-simple to use. Gabbâ€™s engineering
  team joins Memfault to share how they tackle power constraints, OTA updates,
  and safety-first design. Join us live at 8AM PT | 11AM ET | 5PM CET.
