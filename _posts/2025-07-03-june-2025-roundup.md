## Articles & Learning

- [**Linux on the ESP32-S3**](http://wiki.osll.ru/doku.php/etc:users:jcmvbkbc:linux-xtensa:esp32s3)<br>
  After all, why shouldn't we run Linux on an ESP32-S3! – Noah

- [**Run Linux on an arm64 Host for Embedded Dev**](https://www.get-edi.io/Speed-up-Embedded-Development-on-an-arm64-Host/)<br>
  Cuts through Docker/emulation—with EDI on M1/arm64, builds just work faster. –
  Pat

- [**Introducing Sulka, the Hardened Yocto Distro**](https://ejaaskel.dev/introducing-sulka-the-hardened-yocto-distro/)<br>
  Heavy-duty minimal Yocto base, memory-safe userspace, reproducible builds;
  great hardened starting point. – Pat

- [**Let’s Serialize Some DER**](https://alexgaynor.net/2025/jun/20/serialize-some-der/)<br>
  This article checks all the boxes: ASN.1 parsing, Rust, LLM coding, formal
  verification, Arrested Development quote. 😅 – Noah

- [**Watch the Recording – Interrupt Live with Martin Lampacher**](https://www.youtube.com/live/ls_Y45WsTiA)<br>
  Martin Lampacher joined Interrupt Live to share what led him to start his
  _Practical Zephyr_ series, what’s changed since his early experiments, and
  what’s got him excited in embedded today.

## Projects & Tools

- [**uhubctl**](https://github.com/mvp/uhubctl)<br> Classic utility for
  power‑switching USB hubs. – Noah

- [**Embedded Systems Engineering Roadmap**](https://github.com/m3y54m/Embedded-Engineering-Roadmap)<br>
  6.6k stars and growing - everything you'd want to learn from MCU I/O to RTOS
  to firmware CI/CD.

- [**automaticdai/realtime‑embedded‑conferences**](https://github.com/automaticdai/realtime-embedded-conferences)  
  Community-maintained
  list of deadlines and sessions in real-time and embedded systems; great for
  staying ahead. — Matti

- [**mcgill-robotics/AUV-embedded-2025**](https://github.com/mcgill-robotics/auv-embedded-2025)<br>
  Student-built AUV firmware for RoboSub 2025: complete navigation, sensors, ROS
  integration.

## News & Announcements

- [**Nordic Semiconductor acquires Memfault**](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Nordic-news/2025/06/Nordic-Semiconductor-acquires-Memfault)<br>
  Nordic acquires Memfault! 🎉 François Baldassari, Chris Coleman, and Kjetil
  Holstad discuss the acquisition, observability, and the future in embedded
  product development in a Coredump series talk -- listen
  [here](https://memfault.com/resources/memfault-joins-nordic-semiconductor-future-connected-product-development/).

- [**Android 16 Release**](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/16)<br>
  Android 16 has arrived, bringing Live Updates, better multitasking, and
  enhanced privacy, including protection against fake cell towers.

## Events

- [**Tuesday, July 8 – Coredump EP #012: Plug‑and‑Play Cellular Connectivity: Nearly Here or Never Happening?**](https://memfault.com/resources/plug-and-play-cellular-connectivity-nearly-here-or-never-happening/)<br>
  Vincent Korstanje (CEO, Kigen) joins us to unpack the fragmented reality of
  cellular IoT and where the industry is finally making progress. Standards like
  eSIM, iSIM, and new regulations are starting to streamline connectivity—but
  many device makers are still stuck. Join us at 8am PT | 11am ET | 5pm CET.

- [**Tuesday, July 22 – Coredump EP #013: Prepping Your AI Model for the Wild**](https://memfault.com/resources/building-edge-ai-models-for-the-real-world/)<br>
  Edge Impulse’s David Tischler and Alessandro Grande join us to discuss why
  most ML models fail in production, and what to do about it. We’ll talk about
  noisy data, model drift, real-world variability, OTA updates, and what
  observability really means for AI at the edge. Catch it live at 8am PT | 11am
  ET | 5pm CET.

- [**Tuesday, August 19 – _RESCHEDULED_ Coredump EP #015: Developing Kid-Safe Tech at Gabb: What It Takes and Why It’s So Important**](https://memfault.com/resources/developing-kid-safe-tech-at-gabb-what-it-takes-and-why-its-so-important/)<br>
  When you're building tech for kids, reliability isn’t negotiable. Devices need
  to be always-on, always-connected, and dead-simple to use. Gabb’s engineering
  team joins Memfault to share how they tackle power constraints, OTA updates,
  and safety-first design. Join us live at 8AM PT | 11AM ET | 5PM CET.
